# Customization Guide

**How to modify existing modes or create your own**

## üéØ Quick Customization (5 minutes)

### Editing an Existing Mode
Want to tweak how a mode behaves? Just edit the YAML file:

1. **Find the mode file** in [`modes/`](modes/) (e.g., `code.yaml`)
2. **Open it in a text editor** - it's human-readable
3. **Look for the `customInstructions` section** - this controls behavior
4. **Make your changes** - add your preferences, coding standards, etc.
5. **Save and restart VS Code** - changes take effect immediately

**Example customization:**
```yaml
customInstructions: |
  You are an expert coding assistant with these specific preferences:
  - Always use TypeScript instead of JavaScript
  - Prefer functional programming patterns
  - Include comprehensive error handling
  - Write tests for all new functions
  - Follow our company's naming conventions: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes
```

### Adding Your Project-Specific Knowledge
Add information about your specific tech stack or preferences:

```yaml
customInstructions: |
  Context about this project:
  - We use React with Next.js
  - Database is PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
  - Authentication via Auth0
  - Deployment on Vercel
  - We prefer Tailwind CSS for styling
  
  When suggesting solutions, consider these constraints and prefer approaches that fit our stack.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Your Own Mode (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Choose a Template
Start with a template from [`templates/`](templates/):

- **`basic-mode-template.yaml`** - Simple mode with basic functionality
- **`conport-integrated-mode-template.yaml`** - Mode that uses knowledge database
- **`analysis-mode-template.yaml`** - Mode focused on research and analysis

### Step 2: Copy and Rename
```bash
# Copy a template
cp templates/basic-mode-template.yaml modes/my-custom-mode.yaml
```

### Step 3: Edit the Basic Settings
```yaml
slug: my-custom-mode
name: "üé® My Custom Mode"
description: "Specialized mode for [your specific use case]"
```

  - [Area 3]
  
  You always consider [important constraints or preferences].
```

### Step 5: Set Usage Triggers
```yaml
whenToUse: |
  Activate this mode when users:
  - Ask about [specific topic]
  - Need help with [specific task type]
  - Mention keywords like "[keyword1]", "[keyword2]", "[keyword3]"
```

### Step 6: Add Custom Instructions
```yaml
customInstructions: |
  Your approach should be:
  1. [Step or principle 1]
  2. [Step or principle 2]
  3. [Step or principle 3]
  
  Always remember to:

  - Store successful patterns for future reference
  - Link related concepts and decisions
  - Update active context with current [your domain] focus
```

### File Editing Permissions
Control which files your mode can edit:

```yaml
fileEditingScope:
  mode: "allowlist"  # or "blocklist" or "unrestricted"
  patterns:
    - "*.py"         # Only allow editing Python files
    - "*.md"         # And Markdown files

## üöÄ Testing Your Custom Mode

### Quick Test Checklist
- [ ] **File loads without errors** - restart VS Code and check for the mode
- [ ] **AI recognizes the mode** - ask "What modes are available?"
- [ ] **Mode activates correctly** - ask "Use [your-mode] to help me with..."
- [ ] **Behavior matches expectations** - test with a typical use case
- [ ] **ConPort integration works** - if enabled, check that knowledge gets stored

### Iterating and Improving
1. **Use the mode for real work** - this reveals issues and opportunities
2. **Refine the instructions** - add specifics based on what works/doesn't work
3. **Add knowledge** - let the mode build up domain expertise over time
4. **Share successful patterns** - document what works for others to use

## üí° Tips for Effective Custom Modes

### 1. Start Specific, Expand Gradually
- Begin with a narrow, well-defined use case
- Add broader capabilities as you understand what works
- It's easier to expand a focused mode than to focus a broad one

### 2. Use Clear, Actionable Instructions  
- Be specific about what the mode should do
- Include examples of good and bad responses
- Define the mode's personality and approach clearly

### 3. Leverage Existing Patterns
- Study successful modes for inspiration
- Reuse patterns that work well
- Build on the foundation instead of starting from scratch

### 4. Test with Real Work
- Use the mode for actual tasks, not just hypothetical examples
- Iterate based on real usage patterns
- Let the knowledge build up over time

### 5. Document Your Decisions
- Note why you made specific customization choices
- Document successful patterns for future reference
- Share what works with others who might have similar needs

**Remember:** The best custom modes are those that solve specific problems you actually have. Start there and build out.
