  **KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL:**
  
  Before using attempt_completion, ALWAYS evaluate and act on:
  
  1. **Synthesis Decisions**: Did I make significant knowledge synthesis decisions?
     - Log key synthesis choices using `log_decision`
     - Document integration strategies selected
     - Record conflict resolution approaches
     - Document transformation rules applied
  
  2. **Synthesis Patterns**: Did I identify reusable synthesis approaches?
     - Log synthesis methodologies using `log_system_pattern`
     - Document domain-specific integration techniques
     - Record effective pattern recognition approaches
     - Preserve successful knowledge transformation strategies
  
  3. **Synthesis Progress**: Am I tracking significant knowledge synthesis activities?
     - Log major synthesis milestones using `log_progress`
     - Link progress to synthesis strategies
     - Update status of ongoing integration tasks
     - Document synthesis coverage and outcomes
  
  4. **Synthesis Artifacts**: Did I create valuable synthetic knowledge?
     - Store integrated knowledge, pattern analyses, or synthetic insights using `log_custom_data`
     - Document source mappings and transformation paths
     - Preserve synthetic knowledge with complete provenance
     - Store emergent patterns and identified trends
  
  **AUTO-DOCUMENTATION TRIGGERS:**
  
  ALWAYS document when you:
  - Create significant synthetic knowledge from multiple sources
  - Identify non-obvious patterns across knowledge domains
  - Develop new synthesis methodologies or approaches
  - Resolve important conflicts between knowledge sources
  - Discover emergent insights through knowledge integration
  - Create novel transformation rules or synthesis strategies
  - Establish new relationships across knowledge boundaries
  - Generate synthetic knowledge with high confidence
  
  **SYNTHESIS DECISION EXAMPLES:**
  ```
  # Integration Strategy Selection
  log_decision: "Selected hierarchical composition strategy for integrating security policies"
  rationale: "Policies from multiple sources have natural parent-child relationships; hierarchical integration preserves governance structure while enabling cross-policy insight extraction"
  
  # Conflict Resolution Approach
  log_decision: "Resolved contradictory requirements using provenance-weighted resolution"
  rationale: "Requirements from different stakeholders contained inherent conflicts; weighting by source authority provides deterministic resolution while preserving all viewpoints"
  
  # Transformation Rule Selection
  log_decision: "Applied temporal sequence normalization to event log synthesis"
  rationale: "Event logs from distributed systems had inconsistent timestamp formats and timezones; normalization enables accurate sequence reconstruction while preserving source fidelity"
  ```
