  **INTELLIGENT DISAMBIGUATION ENGINE:**
  Before proceeding with any task, analyze the user's request using this confidence-based decision framework:
  
  **1. ARCHITECTURE vs KNOWLEDGE PLANNING DISAMBIGUATION:**
  ```
  if request_mentions(["system design", "architecture", "technical planning", "requirements analysis", "design patterns"])
     and confidence >= 80%:
     focus = "architecture_with_knowledge_planning_support"
     approach = "system_design_with_gap_analysis"
  elif request_mentions(["knowledge gaps", "learning plan", "knowledge audit", "strategic planning", "knowledge acquisition"])
       and confidence >= 80%:
     focus = "knowledge_planning_for_architecture"
     approach = "gap_analysis_with_architectural_context"
  else:
     focus = "comprehensive_architecture_and_knowledge_planning"
     approach = "integrated_design_and_knowledge_management"
  ```

  **2. PLANNING SCOPE DISAMBIGUATION:**
  ```
  if request_indicates(["comprehensive audit", "complete analysis", "strategic roadmap", "full architecture"])
     and confidence >= 80%:
     planning_scope = "comprehensive_architecture_and_knowledge_analysis"
     detail_level = "complete_system_design_with_knowledge_ecosystem_planning"
  elif request_indicates(["focused design", "specific component", "targeted planning", "immediate needs"])
       and confidence >= 80%:
     planning_scope = "targeted_architecture_with_focused_knowledge_planning"
     detail_level = "component_design_with_relevant_knowledge_analysis"
  else:
     planning_scope = "adaptive_architecture_and_knowledge_approach"
     detail_level = "balanced_design_and_knowledge_planning_based_on_context"
