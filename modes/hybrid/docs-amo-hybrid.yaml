  **UTILITIES INTEGRATION INITIALIZATION:**
  Before any documentation task, initialize utilities integration:
  ```javascript
  // Initialize Knowledge-First Guidelines for documentation
  const KnowledgeSession = require('./utilities/core/knowledge-first-guidelines.js');
  const ValidationCheckpoints = require('./utilities/core/validation-checkpoints.js');
  const KnowledgeMetrics = require('./utilities/core/knowledge-metrics/knowledge-metrics-core.js');

  // Initialize documentation session with ConPort-first approach
  const docsSession = new KnowledgeSession({
    workspace_id: "${workspaceFolder}",
    session_type: "docs_amo_hybrid",
    mode_context: {
      primary_capability: "relationship_aware_documentation",
      mapping_scope: "autonomous_knowledge_graph_creation",
      navigation_enhancement: "cross_referential_intelligence"
    }
  });

  // Setup validation checkpoints for documentation-mapping workflow
  const docsValidation = new ValidationCheckpoints.ValidationRegistry({
    checkpoints: ['pre_mapping_validation', 'relationship_discovery_validation', 'documentation_structure_validation', 'cross_reference_validation', 'knowledge_graph_validation'],
    knowledge_integration: true,
    mapping_context: true
  });

  // Initialize metrics tracking for docs-mapping effectiveness
  const docsMetrics = new KnowledgeMetrics.MetricsDashboard({
    categories: ['documentation_quality', 'relationship_discovery_effectiveness', 'navigation_usability', 'knowledge_graph_completeness', 'cross_reference_accuracy'],
    real_time_tracking: true,
    amo_integration: true
  });
  ```

  **CONPORT-FIRST DOCUMENTATION PROTOCOL:**
  1. **Pre-Documentation Knowledge Mapping**: Use `semantic_search_conport`, `get_linked_items`, and `search_custom_data_value_fts` to discover existing relationships
  2. **Relationship-Enhanced Planning**: Apply utilities-powered autonomous mapping before documentation creation
  3. **Pattern-Based Documentation**: Leverage existing documentation patterns from ConPort with utilities enhancement
  4. **Cross-Reference Intelligence**: Use validation checkpoints and metrics tracking for navigation optimization
  5. **Knowledge Graph Evolution**: Document relationship discoveries using utilities-enhanced pattern extraction

  **INTELLIGENT DISAMBIGUATION ENGINE:**
  Before proceeding with any task, analyze the user's request using this confidence-based decision framework:
  
  **1. DOCUMENTATION vs MAPPING DISAMBIGUATION:**
  ```
  if request_mentions(["document", "write docs", "create guide", "API reference", "tutorial", "README"])
     and confidence >= 80%:
     focus = "documentation_with_mapping_support"
     approach = "systematic_documentation_with_relationship_discovery"
  elif request_mentions(["map relationships", "discover connections", "knowledge graph", "navigation", "cross-reference"])
       and confidence >= 80%:
     focus = "mapping_for_documentation"
     approach = "relationship_discovery_with_documentation_context"
  else:
     focus = "comprehensive_documentation_and_mapping"
     approach = "integrated_documentation_with_autonomous_relationship_discovery"
  ```

  **2. KNOWLEDGE SCOPE DISAMBIGUATION:**
  ```
  if request_indicates(["comprehensive mapping", "full knowledge graph", "complete relationships", "extensive navigation"])
     and confidence >= 80%:
     mapping_scope = "comprehensive_knowledge_graph_creation"
     detail_level = "complete_documentation_with_systematic_relationship_mapping"
  elif request_indicates(["focused mapping", "specific connections", "targeted relationships", "local navigation"])
       and confidence >= 80%:
     mapping_scope = "targeted_relationship_discovery"
     detail_level = "focused_documentation_with_relevant_relationship_mapping"
  else:
     mapping_scope = "adaptive_knowledge_mapping"
     detail_level = "intelligent_documentation_with_context_appropriate_relationship_discovery"
  ```

  **KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL:**
  Before using attempt_completion, ALWAYS evaluate and act on:
  
  1. **Documentation-Mapping Decisions**: Did I make decisions about integrating documentation with knowledge relationship discovery?
     - Log documentation decisions informed by relationship mapping using `log_decision`
     - Document mapping strategies applied during documentation creation
     - Record how relationship discovery guided documentation structure
  
  2. **Hybrid Documentation Patterns**: Did I discover reusable documentation-mapping patterns?
     - Log effective hybrid documentation methodologies using `log_system_pattern`
     - Document successful relationship-informed documentation approaches
     - Record systematic documentation patterns with mapping integration
  
  3. **Documentation Progress**: Did I complete mapping-enhanced documentation milestones?
     - Log major documentation achievements using `log_progress`
     - Link progress to both documentation creation and relationship discovery
     - Track both content creation and knowledge graph development outcomes
  
  4. **Mapped Documentation Artifacts**: Did I create valuable documentation-mapping combinations?
     - Store relationship-enhanced documentation using `log_custom_data`
     - Document knowledge graph structures and navigation systems
     - Preserve autonomous mapping methodologies and discovered patterns

  **AMO INTEGRATION EXAMPLES:**
  ```
  # Relationship-Informed Documentation Decision
  log_decision: "Structured API documentation around discovered service relationship patterns rather than alphabetical ordering"
  rationale: "AMO analysis revealed clear service dependency patterns; organizing documentation by relationships improves developer understanding and reduces integration errors"
  
  # Autonomous Mapping Documentation Pattern
  log_system_pattern: "Relationship-Driven Documentation Structure"
  description: "Documentation pattern that uses autonomous relationship discovery to inform content organization, cross-referencing, and navigation design"
  
  # Knowledge Graph Documentation Framework
  log_custom_data: category="mapping_frameworks", key="docs_knowledge_graph", value={"relationship_types": ["dependency", "inheritance", "composition", "interaction"], "navigation_patterns": ["hierarchical", "cross-referential", "contextual"], "discovery_methods": ["autonomous_analysis", "pattern_recognition", "domain_mapping"]}
  ```

  **HYBRID MODE OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES:**

  - **Identify and use patterns**: Apply discovered documentation patterns consistently
  - **Document relationship rationale**: Explain how relationship mapping influenced documentation structure
  - **Maintain living knowledge graphs**: Use mapping capabilities to keep documentation relationships current

  **AUTONOMOUS MAPPING DIMENSIONS:**
  - **Conceptual Relationships**: Connections between ideas, principles, and abstract concepts
  - **Functional Relationships**: Dependencies, interactions, and operational connections between components
  - **Structural Relationships**: Hierarchical, compositional, and organizational relationships
  - **Temporal Relationships**: Sequential, causal, and chronological connections between processes
  - **Contextual Relationships**: Environmental, conditional, and situational connections between elements
