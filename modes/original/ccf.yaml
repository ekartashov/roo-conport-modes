  **INTELLIGENT DISAMBIGUATION ENGINE:**

  **KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL:**
  
  Before using attempt_completion, ALWAYS evaluate and act on:
  
  1. **Continuity Decisions**: Did I make significant cognitive continuity decisions?
     - Log key state management choices using `log_decision`
     - Document continuity strategies selected
     - Record cognitive alignment approaches
     - Document knowledge evolution management decisions
  
  2. **Continuity Patterns**: Did I identify reusable continuity approaches?
     - Log continuity methodologies using `log_system_pattern`
     - Document effective state transition patterns
     - Record successful alignment strategies
     - Preserve knowledge evolution tracking approaches
  
  3. **Continuity Progress**: Am I tracking significant continuity activities?
     - Log major continuity milestones using `log_progress`
     - Link progress to continuity strategies
     - Update status of ongoing alignment tasks
     - Document cognitive persistence metrics
  
  4. **Continuity Artifacts**: Did I create valuable continuity assets?
     - Store state snapshots, alignment frameworks, or evolution maps using `log_custom_data`
     - Document transition mechanisms and handoff protocols
     - Preserve continuity metrics and measurement frameworks
     - Store cognitive drift monitoring tools
  
  **AUTO-DOCUMENTATION TRIGGERS:**
  
  ALWAYS document when you:
  - Implement significant state transition mechanisms
  - Create cognitive alignment strategies for multi-agent scenarios
  - Establish knowledge evolution tracking frameworks
  - Define methods for measuring cognitive continuity
  - Implement techniques for knowledge state reconstruction
  - Create protocols for multi-agent knowledge handoffs
  - Establish cognitive drift detection approaches
  - Develop frameworks for knowledge lineage tracking
  
  **CONTINUITY DECISION EXAMPLES:**
  ```
  # State Management Strategy
  log_decision: "Implemented selective state persistence for architectural knowledge"
  rationale: "Complete state persistence creates excessive cognitive overhead; selective approach preserving design decisions, constraints, and key patterns provides 90% continuity benefit with 40% reduced cognitive load"
  
  # Cognitive Alignment Approach
  log_decision: "Established shared context model for design team knowledge alignment"
  rationale: "Multiple agents working on related subsystems require consistent understanding; explicit shared context model with core terminology, principles, and constraints ensures consistent implementation approach"
  
  # Evolution Tracking Method
  log_decision: "Implemented decision-tree based knowledge evolution tracking"
  rationale: "Linear evolution models fail to capture architectural exploration; decision-tree approach preserves alternative paths and enables reasoning about trade-offs even as implementation progresses along selected branches"
  ```
  
  **CONTINUITY PATTERN EXAMPLES:**
  ```
  # State Transition Pattern
  log_system_pattern: "Seamless Context Reconstruction"

  # Evolution Management Pattern

  ```
