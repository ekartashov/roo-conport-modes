> [!WARNING]
> This repository is being rewritten in a new repository [ekartashov/roo-conport-modes-v2](https://github.com/ekartashov/roo-conport-modes-v2). For now, this repository serves as a source of ideas and a place to store modes created so far. The created modes work better with conport, but the architecture is too messy to continue developing in this repo.


# Roo Modes Collection

**Supercharge your AI assistant with specialized modes for different tasks**

> Transform your AI from a general assistant into a specialized expert that remembers what it learns and gets better over time.

## 🚀 What This Does

Instead of using the same AI for everything, this gives you:

- **🏗️ Architect Mode** - AI becomes a system designer and technical planner
- **💻 Code Mode** - AI becomes a coding specialist with pattern recognition  
- **🪲 Debug Mode** - AI becomes a troubleshooting expert with diagnostic tools
- **📝 Docs Mode** - AI becomes a documentation specialist
- **❓ Ask Mode** - AI becomes a research assistant with deep context

**The key difference**: Your AI remembers decisions, learns patterns, and builds knowledge over time.

## ⚡ Quick Start (2 minutes)

1. **Copy the modes you want** from [`modes/`](modes/) to your Roo configuration
2. **Start using them** - AI automatically gets enhanced capabilities
3. **Watch them improve** - AI learns and remembers for next time

That's it. No complex setup required.

## 📁 What's in This Project

### 🎭 Ready-to-Use Modes
- [`modes/`](modes/) - Drop these into your Roo setup and go
- [`modes/hybrid/`](modes/hybrid/) - Advanced modes that combine multiple capabilities

### 📖 Documentation
- [`docs/getting-started/`](docs/getting-started/) - Setup walkthroughs and quick start guides
- [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/) - How-to guides and common workflows
- [`docs/reference/`](docs/reference/) - Technical references and detailed explanations
- [`docs/troubleshooting/`](docs/troubleshooting/) - FAQ and problem-solving guides

- [`docs/advanced/`](docs/advanced/) - Advanced topics and integrations
- [`templates/`](templates/) - Create your own modes

## 🎯 Popular Use Cases

**Building Software?**
→ Use Architect Mode for planning, Code Mode for implementation, Debug Mode for fixing issues

**Writing Documentation?** 
→ Use Docs Mode for structured content creation and maintenance

**Research Projects?**
→ Use Ask Mode for intelligent information gathering and synthesis

**Complex Projects?**
→ Use Orchestrator Mode to coordinate multiple specialized modes

## 🧠 The Knowledge Advantage

Unlike regular AI, these modes:
- **Remember decisions** you make together
- **Learn patterns** from your projects  
- **Build context** over time
- **Share knowledge** between different tasks

This means your AI gets smarter about your specific work, not just general topics.

## 🎨 Customization

**Want to modify a mode?** Edit the YAML files - they're designed to be readable and changeable.

**Want to create new modes?** Use the templates in [`templates/`](templates/) as starting points.
