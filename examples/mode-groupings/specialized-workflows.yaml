# Specialized Workflows Configuration
# Task-specific groupings for different scenarios

strategy: groupings

mode_groups:
  # Debugging workflow - focused on problem solving
  debugging-focus:
    - debug        # Primary debugging
    - ask          # Ask questions about issues
    - code         # Fix implementation

  # Security review workflow
  security-focus:
    - security-auditor    # Security analysis
    - code               # Code review and fixes
    - ask                # Security questions

  # Learning and exploration workflow
  learning-focus:
    - ask          # Ask questions
    - architect    # Understand system design
    - code         # Try implementations

  # Quick fixes workflow - minimal but effective
  quick-fixes:
    - debug        # Find the issue
    - code         # Fix it

  # Comprehensive review workflow
  comprehensive-review:
    - architect           # System understanding
    - security-auditor    # Security review
    - code               # Implementation review
    - debug              # Issue identification
    - ask                # Clarifications

# Switch between different specialized workflows easily
# Change this to switch focus:
active_group: debugging-focus

# Alternative: Use multiple groups for complex tasks
# active_groups:
#   - debugging-focus
#   - security-focus
# group_order:
#   - debugging-focus
#   - security-focus

# Optional: Always prioritize debugging in any workflow
priority_first:
  - debug

# Optional: Exclude modes not needed for current focus
exclude: []

# Usage Examples:
# 1. For bug fixing: active_group: debugging-focus
# 2. For security work: active_group: security-focus  
# 3. For learning: active_group: learning-focus
# 4. For quick tasks: active_group: quick-fixes
# 5. For thorough review: active_group: comprehensive-review
