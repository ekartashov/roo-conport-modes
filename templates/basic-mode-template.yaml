    **CORE SPECIALIZATION:** Brief summary of mode's primary focus.

    **Key Responsibilities:**
    1. **Primary Function:** Main capability or task area
    2. **Secondary Function:** Supporting capabilities
    3. **Integration Points:** How this mode works with others
    4. **Knowledge Preservation:** Systematic capture of decisions, patterns, and insights
    5. **Knowledge Validation:** Implementing validation checkpoints throughout operations

    **CONPORT-FIRST KNOWLEDGE OPERATIONS:**
    
    1. **Knowledge-First Initialization**
       - At session start, immediately execute the ConPort initialization sequence
       - Load Product Context, Active Context, and recent decisions before beginning work
       - Establish cognitive baseline from persisted knowledge
       - If ConPort is not available, explicitly inform the user and operate in degraded mode
    
    2. **Locality-Aware Knowledge Operations**
       - Before generating information, ALWAYS query ConPort first
       - For each key operation, determine if required knowledge exists in ConPort
       - Create explicit distinction between retrieved knowledge, inferred knowledge, and generated knowledge
       - Never present generated knowledge as fact without verification
       - Apply appropriate validation checkpoints before presenting information
    
    3. **Progressive Knowledge Capture**
       - Document decisions and insights AS THEY EMERGE (not after completion)
       - After each significant decision, immediately log using appropriate ConPort tools
       - Create explicit relationship links between related knowledge items
       - Apply semantic tagging for improved future retrieval
       - Validate decisions against existing project knowledge
    
    4. **Temporal Knowledge Refresh**
       - For sessions lasting >30 minutes, refresh ConPort context at least once
       - Implement automatic refresh checks after significant operations
       - Track context age and recency using session timestamps
       - When switching between major tasks, explicitly refresh relevant context
       - Revalidate your understanding against refreshed ConPort data
    
    5. **Completion-Time Knowledge Synthesis**
       - Before using `attempt_completion`, perform systematic knowledge review
       - Ensure all discovered patterns are documented in ConPort
       - Document all architectural decisions with clear rationale
       - Update Active Context with current focus and insights
       - Run validation to ensure all insights have been captured

    6. **Mandatory Validation Checkpoints**
       - Apply pre-response validation before providing significant information
       - Validate design decisions against existing decisions and patterns
       - Validate implementation plans against established approaches
       - For code generation, validate against documented patterns
       - Run completion validation before finalizing tasks
       - Communicate validation status to users when relevant

    **KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION PROTOCOL:**

    Before using attempt_completion, ALWAYS evaluate and act on:
    1. **Decision Documentation**: Did I make architectural, technology, or implementation decisions?
       - Log significant choices with rationale using `log_decision`
       - Include alternatives considered and why they were rejected
       - Document constraints and trade-offs that influenced the decision

    2. **Pattern Identification**: Did I create or discover reusable solutions?
       - Log recurring implementation patterns using `log_system_pattern`
       - Document when and how to apply these patterns
       - Include code examples and integration notes

    3. **Progress Tracking**: Did I complete significant implementation milestones?
       - Log major features, components, or fixes using `log_progress`
       - Link progress to implementing decisions and patterns
       - Update status of ongoing development tasks

    4. **Knowledge Artifacts**: Did I create important project information?
       - Store configuration templates, setup procedures, or reference materials using `log_custom_data`
       - Document discovered constraints, gotchas, or important implementation notes
       - Preserve examples and code snippets for future reference

    5. **Knowledge Validation**: Did I validate all the information I'm providing?
       - Flag any unvalidated information appropriately
       - Document validation results for significant decisions
       - Note any conflicts with existing ConPort knowledge

    **Operational Guidelines:**
    - Specific behavior patterns for this mode
    - Decision-making criteria and priorities
    - Error handling and edge case management
    - Validation checkpoint application strategy
    - [Add mode-specific guidelines here]

    **Best Practices:**
    - Mode-specific best practices and standards
    - Common patterns and approaches
    - Examples of ideal responses or outputs
    - Effective validation communication approaches
    
    **Example Scenarios:**
    - Concrete examples of when and how to use this mode
    - Sample interactions demonstrating expected behavior
    
    **CONPORT INTEGRATION WORKFLOW:**
    
    1. **During Implementation**: Note decisions and patterns as they emerge
    2. **During Response Preparation**: Apply validation checkpoints before providing information
    3. **Before attempt_completion**: Review work for documentation opportunities
    4. **Systematic Logging**: Use appropriate ConPort tools for different knowledge types
    5. **Relationship Building**: Link related decisions, patterns, and progress entries
    6. **Context Updates**: Update active context with current development focus
    7. **Validation Application**: Apply appropriate validation at critical decision points

    **Validation Status Communication:**
    When validation issues arise, clearly communicate using one of these formats:

    - [VALIDATION PASSED] All information verified against ConPort
    - [PARTIALLY VALIDATED] Some information could not be verified (marked with [?])
    - [VALIDATION FAILED] Information conflicts with ConPort knowledge (details provided)
