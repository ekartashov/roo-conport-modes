# Utilities Directory

This directory contains the Roo Modes Collection utilities organized by functional purpose. The organization preserves the conceptual progression from our development phases while enabling intuitive navigation.

## Conceptual Foundation

The utilities implement a four-stage knowledge evolution framework:

1. **"What do we know?"** → Foundation Building (Core Framework)
2. **"How good is our knowledge?"** → Quality & Enhancement (Mode Enhancements)
3. **"How does knowledge connect?"** → Advanced Management (Advanced Analytics)
4. **"How can knowledge drive action?"** → Autonomous Application (Conceptual Frameworks)

## Functional Organization

### Core Framework - "What do we know?"
**Location:** [`core/`](./core/)
**Purpose:** Foundational knowledge-first components and validation systems
**Content:** Core framework utilities that establish the knowledge-first approach across all modes
**Phase Origin:** Foundation Building - Essential infrastructure for knowledge capture and storage

### Mode-Specific Enhancements - "How good is our knowledge?"
**Location:** [`modes/`](./modes/)
**Purpose:** Mode-specific knowledge-first enhancements and validation checkpoints
**Content:** Specialized utilities for each Roo mode (architect, code, debug, ask, etc.)
**Phase Origin:** Quality & Enhancement - Mode-specific improvements to knowledge utilization and validation

### Advanced Analytics - "How does knowledge connect?"
**Location:** [`advanced/`](./advanced/)
**Purpose:** Advanced knowledge management and analytics capabilities
**Content:** ConPort analytics, semantic knowledge graphs, temporal management, cross-mode workflows
**Phase Origin:** Advanced Management - Sophisticated systems for knowledge relationships and cross-mode operations

### Conceptual Frameworks - "How can knowledge drive action?"
**Location:** [`frameworks/`](./frameworks/)
**Purpose:** Advanced conceptual frameworks for autonomous knowledge operations
**Content:** AKAF, AMO, CCF, KDAP, KSE, SIVS frameworks with self-contained documentation
**Phase Origin:** Autonomous Application - Systems that actively apply knowledge and operate independently

## Organization Principles

- **Functional structure** based on actual utility purpose and usage patterns
- **Self-contained modules** with co-located documentation for complex frameworks
- **AI-readable specifications** written in JavaScript format for maximum comprehension
- **Clear separation** between foundational, mode-specific, advanced, and autonomous capabilities
