# Advanced Frameworks - "How can knowledge drive action?"

Cutting-edge conceptual frameworks for autonomous knowledge operations and AI-readable specifications. These components answer the critical question: **"How can knowledge drive action?"** by implementing autonomous operation frameworks and action-driven knowledge systems.

## Framework Components

### Knowledge Application & Planning
- **[AKAF](./akaf/)** - Adaptive Knowledge Application Framework
  - Intelligently selects and applies stored knowledge to new contexts
  - Provides context-aware knowledge retrieval and application patterns
  
- **[KDAP](./kdap/)** - Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning  
  - Autonomously identifies knowledge gaps and plans acquisition activities
  - Develops strategic approaches to knowledge growth and maintenance

### Optimization & Synthesis
- **[AMO](./amo/)** - Autonomous Mode Optimization
  - Continuously analyzes and optimizes mode performance
  - Provides adaptive enhancement recommendations for mode effectiveness

- **[KSE](./kse/)** - Knowledge Synthesis Engine
  - Autonomously combines knowledge sources to generate new insights
  - Creates unified understanding from distributed knowledge artifacts

### Validation & Continuity
- **[SIVS](./sivs/)** - Self-Improving Validation System
  - Evolution of validation checkpoints that learns from past validations
  - Continuously improves validation accuracy and coverage

- **[CCF](./ccf/)** - Cognitive Continuity Framework
  - Ensures knowledge continuity across sessions, agents, and time periods
  - Manages context transitions and knowledge state preservation

## Architecture

Each framework follows a standardized three-layer architecture:

1. **Validation Layer** (`*-validation.js`) - Ensures data integrity and input validation
2. **Core Layer** (`*-core.js`) - Implements fundamental framework logic and operations  
3. **Integration Layer** (`*-integration.js`) - Handles external system communication and ConPort integration

## Documentation Structure

Each framework includes:
- **README.md** - Framework overview and usage guide
- **Examples/** - Practical usage demonstrations
- **Tests/** - Validation and functionality tests
- **index.js** - Main export and API surface

## Usage

These frameworks represent the most advanced capabilities in the Roo Modes ecosystem. They are designed for autonomous operation and can be integrated individually or as part of comprehensive knowledge management workflows.

## AI-Readable Design

All framework specifications are written in JavaScript format to maximize AI comprehension while maintaining human readability. The code serves as both specification and conceptual documentation.
