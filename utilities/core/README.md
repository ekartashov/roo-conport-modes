# Core Framework - "What do we know?"

Foundational utilities that establish the knowledge-first approach across all Roo modes. These components answer the fundamental question: **"What do we know?"** by providing the essential infrastructure for knowledge capture, storage, and basic validation.

## Components

### Knowledge Framework
- [`knowledge-first-guidelines.js`](./knowledge-first-guidelines.js) - Core principles and guidelines for knowledge-first operations
- [`knowledge-first-initialization.js`](./knowledge-first-initialization.js) - Framework initialization and session management

### Validation & Quality
- [`validation-checkpoints.js`](./validation-checkpoints.js) - Core validation checkpoints for knowledge operations
- [`conport-validation-manager.js`](./conport-validation-manager.js) - ConPort database validation and integrity management

### Analysis & Classification
- [`data-locality-detector.js`](./data-locality-detector.js) - Analysis of data locality and access patterns
- [`knowledge-metrics-dashboard.js`](./knowledge-metrics-dashboard.js) - Knowledge utilization metrics and monitoring
- [`knowledge-source-classifier.js`](./knowledge-source-classifier.js) - Classification and categorization of knowledge sources

## Purpose

These utilities provide the foundational layer for knowledge-first operations:
- Framework initialization and core guidelines
- Validation systems ensuring knowledge quality and consistency
- Analysis tools for understanding knowledge patterns and usage
- Integration patterns for ConPort database operations

## Usage

Core utilities are designed to be used by all modes and higher-level frameworks. They provide the essential infrastructure upon which mode-specific enhancements and advanced frameworks are built.
