# Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning (KDAP)

## Overview
The Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning (KDAP) component enables AI systems to autonomously identify knowledge gaps and plan for knowledge acquisition activities. It continuously analyzes the knowledge ecosystem, identifies gaps, generates acquisition plans, executes them, and evaluates their impact.

## Key Capabilities
- **Knowledge State Analysis**: Builds comprehensive models of the current knowledge ecosystem
- **Gap Identification**: Uses multiple strategies to identify areas where knowledge is lacking
- **Plan Generation**: Creates actionable knowledge acquisition plans based on identified gaps
- **Plan Execution**: Orchestrates the execution of knowledge acquisition plans
- **Impact Evaluation**: Evaluates the impact of newly acquired knowledge
- **ConPort Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with ConPort for knowledge storage and retrieval

## Architecture
KDAP follows a layered architecture:

1. **Core Layer**: Provides fundamental functionality through five main classes:
   - `KnowledgeStateAnalyzer`: Builds a model of the current knowledge ecosystem
   - `GapIdentificationEngine`: Applies multiple strategies to identify knowledge gaps
   - `PlanGenerationSystem`: Creates knowledge acquisition plans
   - `ExecutionOrchestrator`: Carries out knowledge acquisition plans
   - `KnowledgeImpactEvaluator`: Evaluates the outcomes of knowledge acquisition

2. **Validation Layer**: Ensures quality and consistency through validations:
   - `validateGapAssessment`: Validates gap assessments
   - `validateKnowledgeAcquisitionPlan`: Validates knowledge acquisition plans
   - `validateExecutionProgress`: Validates execution progress
   - `validateAcquiredKnowledge`: Validates acquired knowledge

3. **Integration Layer**: Connects with other systems:
   - `ConPortKnowledgeInterface`: Handles interactions with ConPort
   - `Phase4ComponentConnectors`: Facilitates communication with other Phase 4 systems
   - `ExternalApiHandler`: Provides APIs for external interaction
   - `StateManagementSystem`: Manages state persistence
   - `KdapIntegrationManager`: Coordinates all integration components

## Usage
```javascript
const { initializeKDAP } = require('./kdap');

// Initialize KDAP with configuration options
const kdap = initializeKDAP({
  conPortClient: conPortClient,
  analyzerOptions: { /* options */ },
  gapIdentifierOptions: { /* options */ }
});

// Run an autonomous knowledge improvement workflow
const result = await kdap.runAutonomousWorkflow('workspace-id');

// Or use individual components
const knowledgeState = kdap.analyzeKnowledgeState(context);
const gaps = kdap.identifyGaps(knowledgeState);
const plan = kdap.generatePlan(gaps, context);
```

## Integration with Other Phase 4 Components
- **AKAF**: Notifies AKAF of knowledge gaps for optimized knowledge application
- **SIVS**: Requests validation patterns from SIVS for knowledge validation
- **KSE**: Requests knowledge synthesis from KSE to address gaps
- **CCF**: Registers planning sessions with CCF for cognitive continuity

## Further Development
- Enhance gap identification strategies with more sophisticated algorithms
- Improve knowledge acquisition planning with machine learning
- Extend integration with external knowledge sources
