## Integration with Cross-Mode Workflows

The advanced utilities seamlessly integrate with the cross-mode workflows coordination layer:

### Enhanced Mode Coordination

- **architect-kdap-hybrid**: Enhanced with quality assessment for architectural decisions
- **code-kse-hybrid**: Integrated with semantic knowledge synthesis
- **debug-sivs-hybrid**: Enhanced with temporal tracking for debugging sessions
- **docs-amo-hybrid**: Integrated with relationship mapping for documentation
- **orchestrator-ccf-hybrid**: Enhanced with comprehensive coordination analytics

### Workflow Enhancement Mappings

Each hybrid mode receives targeted enhancements:

```yaml
architect_workflows:
  requirements_analysis:
    quality_dimensions: ["completeness", "clarity", "relevance", "structure"]
    semantic_discovery: ["requirements", "stakeholders", "constraints"]
    temporal_tracking: true

code_workflows:
  implementation_planning:
    quality_dimensions: ["completeness", "clarity", "structure", "traceability"]
    semantic_discovery: ["implementation", "patterns", "dependencies"]
    temporal_tracking: true
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Enhanced Workflow Execution

```javascript
// Initialize advanced utilities integration
const advancedUtilities = createAdvancedUtilitiesIntegration({
  workspaceId: "${workspaceFolder}",
  conPortClient: conPortClient,
  crossModeWorkflows: crossModeWorkflows
});

// Execute enhanced workflow
const result = await advancedUtilities.executeEnhancedWorkflow(workflowDef, context);
```

### Comprehensive Impact Analysis

```javascript
// Perform multi-dimensional impact analysis
const impactAnalysis = await advancedUtilities.performComprehensiveImpactAnalysis({
  artifactType: 'decision',
  artifactId: 'architectural_decision_123',
  depth: 2
});

console.log(`Total impacted items: ${impactAnalysis.combinedInsights.totalImpactedItems}`);
console.log(`Quality score: ${impactAnalysis.combinedInsights.qualityScore}`);
console.log(`Risk level: ${impactAnalysis.combinedInsights.riskLevel}`);
```

### Knowledge Graph Building

```javascript
// Build comprehensive knowledge graph
const knowledgeGraph = await advancedUtilities.buildWorkflowKnowledgeGraph({
  rootItemType: 'decision',
  rootItemId: 'system_architecture_decision',
