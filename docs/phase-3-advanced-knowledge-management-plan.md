# Phase 3: Advanced Knowledge Management Plan

## Overview

Phase 3 builds on the foundations established in Phases 1 and 2 to implement advanced knowledge management capabilities across the ConPort system. While Phase 1 created the foundational infrastructure and Phase 2 enhanced individual modes with knowledge-first capabilities, Phase 3 focuses on advanced cross-mode knowledge operations, semantic understanding, and intelligent knowledge lifecycle management.

## Objectives

1. **Semantic Knowledge Integration**: Implement semantic understanding and relationship discovery between knowledge artifacts
2. **Cross-Mode Knowledge Operations**: Create unified knowledge workflows that span multiple modes
3. **Temporal Knowledge Management**: Develop capabilities for tracking knowledge evolution over time
4. **Knowledge Quality Enhancement**: Build systems for automated quality assessment and improvement
5. **Advanced ConPort Analytics**: Implement comprehensive analytics for knowledge usage and effectiveness
