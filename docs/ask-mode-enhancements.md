# Ask Mode Enhancements

## Overview

The Ask Mode Enhancements provide specialized validation checkpoints and knowledge-first guidelines for information retrieval, answer validation, and knowledge persistence. These enhancements transform Ask Mode from a simple Q&A interface into a knowledge-powered system that ensures information accuracy, source reliability, answer completeness, and contextual relevance.

The enhancements implement System Pattern #31: "Mode-Specific Knowledge-First Enhancement Pattern" for Ask Mode, focusing on information quality, knowledge extraction from answers, and effective knowledge persistence.

## Key Components

The Ask Mode Enhancements consist of three primary components:

1. **Validation Checkpoints**: Specialized validators that assess answer quality along four dimensions
2. **Knowledge-First Guidelines**: Strategies for information retrieval, source assessment, and knowledge extraction
3. **Integration Module**: A unified interface for validation, knowledge management, and ConPort integration

### Validation Checkpoints

The Ask Mode validation checkpoints focus on four critical aspects of information quality:

#### Information Accuracy Checkpoint

Validates the factual accuracy of information in answers:

- Assesses factual consistency, technical precision, and contextual correctness
- Evaluates the presence and quality of citations when required
- Identifies known inaccuracies that must be corrected

#### Source Reliability Checkpoint

Validates the reliability and credibility of information sources:

- Evaluates source types against a reliability hierarchy (official documentation > peer-reviewed > etc.)
- Assesses sufficient sources for claims
- Checks source freshness and relevance

#### Answer Completeness Checkpoint

Validates that answers fully address all aspects of the question:

- Ensures required components are present (direct answer, explanation, context)
- Checks for recommended components (examples, limitations, alternatives)
- Verifies all aspects of multi-part questions are addressed

#### Contextual Relevance Checkpoint

Validates that answers are relevant to the user's context and needs:

- Assesses alignment with the specific question asked
- Evaluates relevance to the user's context (skill level, project needs)
- Checks technical level matching and application focus

### Knowledge-First Guidelines

The Ask Mode Knowledge-First Guidelines provide strategies for:

#### Information Retrieval Strategies

Four specialized retrieval strategies tailored to different question types:

1. **Hierarchical**: Start with authoritative sources, then broaden (ideal for factual/technical questions)
2. **Comparative**: Retrieve multiple perspective sources for comparison (ideal for comparison/decision questions)
3. **Historical**: Focus on evolution over time (ideal for trend/evolution questions)
4. **Community Consensus**: Prioritize community practices (ideal for best practice questions)

#### Answer Formulation Templates

Templates for structuring answers based on question type and audience:

1. **Technical Detailed**: For expert-level technical explanations
2. **Practical Guide**: For actionable, step-by-step instructions
3. **Conceptual Overview**: For beginner-friendly explanations
4. **Comparative Analysis**: For decision-making support

#### Knowledge Extraction Patterns

Patterns for identifying valuable knowledge in answers for persistence:

1. **Definition**: Extract formal definitions of terms and concepts
2. **Best Practice**: Extract recommended approaches and methodologies
3. **Constraint**: Extract limitations and technical constraints
4. **Comparison Insight**: Extract comparative insights between technologies

### Integration Module

The Ask Mode Enhancement module provides a unified interface that integrates:

- Validation checkpoint execution and result processing
- Retrieval strategy selection based on question type
- Answer template selection based on audience and question
- Knowledge extraction and ConPort persistence
- Active context updates to track information needs

## Usage

The Ask Mode Enhancements are designed to be used at different stages of the question-answer process:

### During Question Analysis

```javascript
// Select appropriate retrieval strategy
const retrievalStrategy = askEnhancement.selectRetrievalStrategy(question, context);

// Retrieve relevant knowledge from ConPort
const retrievedKnowledge = await askEnhancement.retrieveKnowledge(question, context);

// Select appropriate answer template
const answerTemplate = askEnhancement.selectAnswerTemplate(question, context);
```

### During Answer Validation

```javascript
// Validate an answer
const validationResults = askEnhancement.validateAnswer(answer, { question, ...context });

// Improve an answer based on validation results
const improvedAnswer = askEnhancement.improveAnswer(answer, validationResults, context);
```

### During Knowledge Persistence

```javascript
// Extract knowledge from an answer
const extractedKnowledge = askEnhancement.extractKnowledge(answer, question, context);

// Persist knowledge to ConPort
const persistResult = await askEnhancement.persistKnowledge(extractedKnowledge, context);

// Update active context
await askEnhancement.updateActiveContext(question, answer, context);
```

### Complete Workflow

```javascript
// Process a complete question-answer cycle
const processResult = await askEnhancement.processQuestionAnswer(question, answer, context);
```

## ConPort Integration

The Ask Mode Enhancements integrate deeply with ConPort for:

### Knowledge Retrieval

- **Semantic Search**: Uses `semantic_search_conport` for conceptual understanding
- **Glossary Search**: Uses `search_project_glossary_fts` for term definitions
- **Custom Data Search**: Uses `search_custom_data_value_fts` for specific categories
- **Decision Search**: Uses `search_decisions_fts` for past decision context

### Knowledge Persistence

- **Project Glossary**: Stores term definitions with `log_custom_data`
- **Best Practices**: Captures recommended approaches with `log_custom_data`
- **Constraints**: Records limitations and technical constraints with `log_custom_data`
- **Comparative Insights**: Preserves technology comparisons with `log_custom_data`
- **Significant Insights**: Logs important insights as decisions with `log_decision`

### Context Maintenance

- **Active Context**: Updates current focus and recent queries with `update_active_context`
- **Knowledge Linking**: Creates relationships between related items with `link_conport_items`

## Implementation Decisions

### Decision #59: Ask Mode Knowledge-First Implementation Approach

**Summary**: Implemented Ask Mode enhancements focusing on information quality validation and structured knowledge extraction

**Rationale**:
- Ask Mode fundamentally involves information retrieval, evaluation, and synthesis
- Information quality is paramount, requiring specialized validation dimensions
- Different question types benefit from tailored retrieval strategies
- Answers contain valuable knowledge that should be systematically extracted and persisted
- User context significantly impacts appropriate answer structure and detail level

**Implementation Details**:
- Created four specialized validation checkpoints addressing critical information quality dimensions
- Implemented retrieval strategies tailored to common question types
- Developed answer templates for different audience technical levels
- Created knowledge extraction patterns for definitions, best practices, constraints, and comparisons
- Integrated deeply with ConPort for bidirectional knowledge flow

**Benefits**:
- Ensures information accuracy and reliability in answers
- Tailors information retrieval to question type
- Adapts answer structure to user context
- Systematically captures knowledge from answers for future use
- Builds a connected knowledge graph over time

### Approach for Knowledge Extraction

A critical aspect of the Ask Mode enhancements is the systematic extraction of knowledge from answers. Unlike other modes where knowledge might be primarily generated during the development process, Ask Mode receives external knowledge that needs to be evaluated and selectively preserved.

The implementation uses pattern-based extraction with regular expressions to identify:
- Formal definitions that should be added to the Project Glossary
- Best practices that should be preserved for future reference
- Technical constraints that impact project decisions
- Comparative insights that influence technology choices

Each extraction includes confidence assessment based on source reliability, enabling selective persistence of only high-confidence knowledge.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for Ask Mode include:

1. **Machine Learning-Based Knowledge Extraction**: Replace regex-based extraction with ML models
2. **Answer Quality Metrics**: Implement quantitative metrics for tracking answer quality over time
3. **Interactive Answer Refinement**: Enable interactive improvement of answers based on validation results
4. **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Identify and track information gaps to prioritize knowledge acquisition
5. **Source Authority Verification**: Implement verification of source authenticity and authority

## Relationship to Other Modes

Ask Mode Enhancements build on the foundation of:
- The general "Mode-Specific Knowledge-First Enhancement Pattern" (System Pattern #31)
- ConPort Validation Strategy established for all modes
- Knowledge Source Classification system

The knowledge extracted in Ask Mode can directly inform:
- Architect Mode decisions through persisted comparative insights
- Code Mode implementations through best practices
- Debug Mode diagnostics through known constraints and limitations
