# Hybrid Framework Ecosystem - User Guide

## üéØ Quick Start: Getting the Power You Need

**Your Problem Solved**: You now have an AI system that automatically switches to the right mode while preserving all context and discovered knowledge across transitions.

### Immediate Benefits
- **Automatic Mode Selection**: AI analyzes your request and picks the optimal mode
- **Zero Context Loss**: All knowledge, decisions, and progress persist across mode switches
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Framework automatically manages complex multi-mode workflows
- **Enterprise-Grade Persistence**: Everything saved in ConPort for future sessions

## üöÄ How to Use the Framework

### 1. **Simple Usage** (Most Common)
Just describe what you want - the framework handles everything:

```
"I need to build a React app with user authentication"
‚Üí Framework automatically uses Intelligent Mode Selector
‚Üí Selects Code+KSE Hybrid mode
‚Üí Implements solution while documenting patterns
‚Üí Preserves all knowledge in ConPort
```

### 2. **Explicit Mode Usage** (When You Know What You Want)
Use any hybrid mode directly:

- **`roo code-kse-hybrid`** - Coding with Knowledge Synthesis
- **`roo architect-kdap-hybrid`** - Architecture with Autonomous Planning  
- **`roo debug-sivs-hybrid`** - Debugging with Self-Improving Validation
- **`roo docs-amo-hybrid`** - Documentation with Autonomous Mapping
- **`roo orchestrator-ccf-hybrid`** - Complex workflows with Cognitive Continuity

### 3. **Automatic Orchestration** (For Complex Projects)
```
"Plan and implement a complete e-commerce platform"
‚Üí Framework uses Orchestrator+CCF mode
‚Üí Automatically breaks down into phases
‚Üí Switches between appropriate modes as needed
‚Üí Maintains perfect context continuity
```

## üß† How the Intelligence Works

### Intelligent Mode Selector
- **Task Analysis**: AI examines your request for complexity, domain, and requirements
- **Confidence-Based Decisions**: High confidence = immediate action, low confidence = clarifying questions
- **Performance Learning**: System improves mode selection based on past successes

### Enhanced Cognitive Continuity Framework (CCF)
- **Framework State Manager**: Preserves all AI reasoning and decision context
- **Coordination Engine**: Manages seamless transitions between modes
- **Context Reconstruction**: Rebuilds complete context when switching modes

### ConPort Workflow Bus
- **Persistent Memory**: All knowledge stored permanently across sessions
- **Event-Driven Coordination**: Automatic triggering of related workflows
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Modes can coordinate without blocking

## üìã Practical Workflows

### Web Development Project
1. **Start**: `"Build a modern web app with authentication and dashboard"`
2. **Framework Response**: Automatically selects Architect+KDAP mode for planning
3. **Auto-Switch**: Transitions to Code+KSE mode for implementation
4. **Knowledge Capture**: Documents all patterns, decisions, and components
5. **Testing**: Switches to Debug+SIVS mode for comprehensive validation

### Documentation Project  
1. **Start**: `"Create comprehensive API documentation"`
2. **Framework Response**: Selects Docs+AMO mode automatically
3. **Knowledge Mapping**: Maps relationships between API endpoints
4. **Auto-Enhancement**: Generates interactive examples and usage guides

### Complex System Architecture
1. **Start**: `"Design microservices architecture for e-commerce"`
2. **Framework Response**: Uses Orchestrator+CCF for complex coordination
3. **Multi-Mode Workflow**: 
   - Architect+KDAP: System design and planning
   - Code+KSE: Implementation with pattern synthesis  
   - Debug+SIVS: Multi-dimensional validation
   - Docs+AMO: Architecture documentation and mapping

## üéõÔ∏è Framework Control Commands

### Workflow Management
- **`Sync ConPort`** - Synchronize all session knowledge to persistent storage
- **`Framework Status`** - View current framework state and active coordination
- **`Switch Mode: [mode-name]`** - Explicit mode switching with context transfer

### Knowledge Operations
- **`Search Knowledge: [query]`** - Semantic search across all project knowledge
- **`Link Concepts: [concept1] -> [concept2]`** - Create knowledge relationships
- **`Export Knowledge`** - Generate comprehensive project documentation

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Mode switches seem slow**
A: Framework is transferring complete context. This ensures zero knowledge loss. Use `Framework Status` to monitor transfer progress.

**Q: AI picked wrong mode**
A: Use explicit mode syntax: `roo [mode-name]` or provide more specific requirements in your request.

**Q: Lost context after restart**
A: Run `Sync ConPort` before ending sessions. Framework auto-syncs but manual sync ensures complete persistence.

### Performance Optimization
- **Session Continuity**: Framework automatically maintains state across sessions
- **Knowledge Caching**: Frequently used patterns cached for faster access
- **Workflow Learning**: System improves performance based on usage patterns

---

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. **Trust the Automation**
- Let the framework choose modes automatically for best results
- Provide clear, specific requirements for optimal mode selection

### 2. **Use Explicit Control When Needed**
- For specialized tasks, directly invoke specific hybrid modes
- Use orchestrator mode for complex multi-phase projects

### 3. **Leverage Knowledge Persistence**
- All decisions, patterns, and discoveries automatically preserved
- Reference past projects with semantic search capabilities
- Build on previous knowledge for faster development

### 4. **Workflow Coordination**
- Framework handles mode transitions automatically
- Manual coordination available through ConPort Workflow Bus
- Event-driven triggers enable automated workflow management

---

## üéì Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflow Creation
Framework allows creating custom multi-mode workflows:

```yaml
workflow_name: "full_stack_development"
phases:
  - mode: "architect-kdap-hybrid"
    task: "System architecture and planning"
  - mode: "code-kse-hybrid" 
    task: "Backend implementation with pattern synthesis"
  - mode: "code-kse-hybrid"
    task: "Frontend implementation with component patterns"
  - mode: "debug-sivs-hybrid"
    task: "Comprehensive testing and validation"
  - mode: "docs-amo-hybrid"
    task: "Documentation and knowledge mapping"
```

### Framework Extension
- **Custom Triggers**: Define ConPort events that trigger specific modes
- **Knowledge Integration**: Connect external knowledge sources to framework
- **Workflow Optimization**: Framework learns and optimizes based on your patterns
