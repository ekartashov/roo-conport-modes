# What Each Mode Does

**Simple explanations of what you get with each mode**

## üèóÔ∏è Architect Mode
**What it does:** Turns your AI into a system designer and technical planner

**Use it when you want to:**
- Plan out a software project before coding
- Design system architecture and data flows  
- Make technical decisions with pros/cons analysis
- Create project roadmaps and implementation strategies

**Example:** *"Help me architect a social media app with user authentication, posts, and real-time messaging"*

**What makes it special:** Remembers architectural decisions and patterns, suggests proven approaches, thinks in terms of scalability and maintainability.

## üíª Code Mode  
**What it does:** Turns your AI into a coding specialist with pattern recognition

**Use it when you want to:**
- Write, review, or refactor code
- Implement features and fix bugs
- Get coding best practices and optimizations
- Learn new programming languages or frameworks

**Example:** *"Implement a REST API for user management with JWT authentication"*

**What makes it special:** Learns your coding patterns, remembers successful solutions, suggests improvements based on your project history.

## ü™≤ Debug Mode
**What it does:** Turns your AI into a troubleshooting expert with diagnostic tools

**Use it when you want to:**
- Figure out why something isn't working
- Get systematic debugging approaches
- Understand error messages and stack traces
- Performance troubleshooting and optimization

**Example:** *"My React component is re-rendering too much and slowing down the app"*

**What makes it special:** Builds a database of common issues and solutions, suggests systematic debugging approaches, learns from your specific codebase.

## üìù Docs Mode
**What it does:** Turns your AI into a documentation specialist

**Use it when you want to:**
- Write clear, structured documentation
- Create API docs, user guides, or technical specs
- Organize and maintain existing documentation
- Generate docs from code or specifications

**Example:** *"Create user documentation for our project management API"*

**What makes it special:** Understands documentation structure, maintains consistency across documents, learns your documentation style and standards.

## ‚ùì Ask Mode
**What it does:** Turns your AI into a research assistant with deep context

**Use it when you want to:**
- Get detailed explanations of technical concepts
- Research tools, frameworks, or approaches
- Compare different solutions with pros/cons
- Get contextual advice for your specific situation

**Example:** *"What's the best way to handle real-time updates in a web app? Consider our current React/Node.js stack"*

**What makes it special:** Builds context about your tech stack and preferences, provides more relevant answers over time, remembers previous research topics.

---

## ü™É Orchestrator Mode
**What it does:** Coordinates between different modes and manages complex workflows

**Use it when you want to:**
- Work on large, multi-phase projects
- Switch between different types of tasks seamlessly
- Coordinate planning, coding, documentation, and debugging
- Manage complex workflows that need multiple specialties

**Example:** *"Help me build a complete e-commerce platform - from planning to deployment"*

**What makes it special:** Knows when to switch between different modes, maintains context across different types of work, coordinates complex multi-step projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hybrid Modes (Advanced)

### Code + Knowledge Synthesis (code-kse-hybrid)
Regular Code Mode + ability to synthesize patterns across different projects and domains

### Architect + Planning (architect-kdap-hybrid)  
Regular Architect Mode + autonomous planning and knowledge-driven design decisions

### Debug + Validation (debug-sivs-hybrid)
Regular Debug Mode + self-improving diagnostic approaches and comprehensive validation

### Docs + Mapping (docs-amo-hybrid)
Regular Docs Mode + automatic relationship discovery and knowledge graph creation

### Orchestrator + Continuity (orchestrator-ccf-hybrid)
Regular Orchestrator Mode + cognitive continuity across complex workflows and time gaps

## The Knowledge Advantage

**All modes share these benefits:**

- **They remember** - Decisions, patterns, and solutions are saved for future use
- **They learn** - Each interaction improves future responses
- **They connect** - Knowledge from one mode helps inform the others
- **They adapt** - They get better at understanding your specific needs and context

**Think of it like having specialists who:**
- Keep detailed notes about your projects
- Learn your preferences and coding style
- Share insights with each other
- Get smarter about your work over time

## Choosing the Right Mode

**For a typical software project, you might use:**

1. **Architect Mode** - Plan the system
2. **Code Mode** - Implement features  
3. **Debug Mode** - Fix issues that come up
4. **Docs Mode** - Write user guides and API docs
5. **Ask Mode** - Research new tools or approaches
6. **Orchestrator Mode** - Coordinate everything when it gets complex

**Start simple:** Pick one or two modes that match your immediate needs. You can always add more later.
