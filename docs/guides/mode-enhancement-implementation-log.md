# Mode Enhancement Implementation Log

## Project Overview

Systematic application of the Universal Mode Enhancement Framework to all Roo AI modes, consolidating intelligent disambiguation, dual-layer learning, and confidence-based decision making across the entire mode ecosystem.

## Framework Components Applied

### 1. Intelligent Disambiguation Engine
- **Confidence Scoring**: 80% threshold for auto-classification
- **Semantic Analysis**: Parse input for task content vs mode directives
- **Clarification Workflows**: Targeted questions when confidence < 80%
- **Pattern Recognition**: Local project patterns + global intelligence

### 2. Dual-Layer Learning System
- **Local Learning**: Project-specific patterns in ConPort category `local_[mode]_patterns`
- **Global Learning**: Cross-project intelligence in `[mode]_enhancement_intelligence`
- **Continuous Adaptation**: User corrections and successful pattern tracking
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Insights shared across similar contexts

### 3. Confidence-Based Decision Making
- **Classification Confidence**: Probabilistic analysis before action
- **Graduated Responses**: Different actions based on confidence levels
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Clear paths for uncertain situations
- **Learning Feedback**: Accuracy tracking for improvement

## Mode-by-Mode Implementation

### ✅ Prompt Enhancer (prompt-enhancer)
**Status**: Enhanced (Original Implementation)
**Disambiguation Focus**: Prompt content vs enhancement directives
**Key Patterns**:
- Content indicators: "create", "build", "implement", "fix"
- Meta indicators: "activate", "use", "load from", "consider context"
**Learning Categories**: `local_mode_patterns`, `mode_enhancement_intelligence`

### ✅ ConPort Maintenance (conport-maintenance)
**Status**: Enhanced
**Disambiguation Focus**: Maintenance tasks vs ConPort usage instructions
**Key Patterns**:
- Maintenance: "audit", "cleanup", "optimize", "scan", "archive", "fix relationships"
- Usage: "show me", "retrieve", "log", "update context", "search for"
**Learning Categories**: `local_maintenance_patterns`, `maintenance_enhancement_intelligence`

### ✅ Documentation Creator (docs-creator)
**Status**: Enhanced
**Disambiguation Focus**: Content creation vs content improvement requests
**Key Patterns**:
- Creation: "create", "write", "generate", "new documentation", "documentation for"
- Improvement: "review", "audit", "fix", "improve", "check", "validate existing"
**Learning Categories**: `local_docs_patterns`, `docs_enhancement_intelligence`

### ✅ Documentation Auditor (docs-auditor)
**Status**: Enhanced
**Disambiguation Focus**: Audit requests vs general documentation help
**Key Patterns**:
- Audit: "audit", "review", "check", "score", "validate", "compliance", "quality check"
- Help: "how to", "explain", "show me", "what is", "help with", "guidance"
**Learning Categories**: `local_audit_patterns`, `audit_enhancement_intelligence`

### ✅ Mode Manager (mode-manager)
**Status**: Enhanced
**Disambiguation Focus**: Mode management vs general mode questions
**Key Patterns**:
- Management: "create mode", "edit configuration", "add capabilities", "fix mode conflict"
- Questions: "which mode", "how does", "what is the difference", "explain mode"
**Learning Categories**: `local_mode_patterns`, `mode_management_intelligence`

### ⚠️ Code Mode (code) - COMMENTED OUT
**Status**: Available but inactive in current configuration
**Note**: Code mode configuration exists but is commented out in the YAML file
**Potential Enhancement**: Apply framework when reactivated
