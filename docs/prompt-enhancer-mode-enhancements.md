# Prompt Enhancer Mode Enhancements

This document describes the specialized enhancements implemented for the Prompt Enhancer Mode, following the "Mode-Specific Knowledge-First Enhancement Pattern" (System Pattern #31).

## Overview

The Prompt Enhancer Mode is designed to transform vague or incomplete prompts into clear, detailed, and actionable instructions. The enhancements implement intelligent disambiguation capabilities to separate prompt content from enhancement directives, and apply structured enhancement techniques based on content domain and requirements.

## Architecture

The Prompt Enhancer Mode enhancement consists of three primary components:

1. **Validation Checkpoints**: Specialized validation rules focused on prompt clarity, completeness, improvement metrics, and disambiguation accuracy.

2. **Knowledge-First Module**: Provides access to prompt templates, enhancement techniques, disambiguation patterns, and project-specific knowledge from ConPort.

3. **Mode Enhancement Integration**: Combines validation and knowledge components into a cohesive workflow for prompt enhancement.

## Components

### 1. Prompt Enhancer Validation Checkpoints

Located in `utilities/mode-enhancements/prompt-enhancer-validation-checkpoints.js`, these checkpoints validate:

- **Prompt Clarity**: Verifies that enhanced prompts are clear, specific, and unambiguous.
- **Prompt Completeness**: Ensures enhanced prompts include all necessary context and requirements.
- **Prompt Improvement**: Measures the improvement over the original prompt using multiple metrics.
- **Disambiguation Accuracy**: Validates the accurate separation of content from meta-instructions.

### 2. Prompt Enhancer Knowledge-First

Located in `utilities/mode-enhancements/prompt-enhancer-knowledge-first.js`, this module provides:

- **Disambiguation Patterns**: Rules and patterns for separating content from meta-instructions.
- **Prompt Templates**: Structured templates for different types of prompts (basic, technical, UI).
- **Enhancement Techniques**: Strategies for improving prompts (context enhancement, requirement decomposition, etc.).
- **Domain Detection**: Automatic identification of prompt domain (UI, backend, data processing, etc.).

### 3. Prompt Enhancer Mode Enhancement

Located in `utilities/mode-enhancements/prompt-enhancer-mode-enhancement.js`, this integration module:

- Orchestrates the prompt enhancement workflow
- Handles clarification requests for ambiguous segments
- Applies validation fixes for failed validations
- Tracks enhancement history and metrics
- Integrates with ConPort for knowledge persistence

## Key Features

### Intelligent Disambiguation

The Prompt Enhancer Mode can analyze inputs to separate:

- **Content to enhance**: The actual prompt that needs improvement
- **Meta-instructions**: Directives about how to perform the enhancement

This is done using a confidence-based analysis system that:

1. Analyzes each segment of the input
2. Assigns confidence scores based on pattern matching
3. Identifies segments requiring clarification (confidence < 0.8)
4. Generates appropriate clarification questions

### Dual-Layer Learning

The enhancement system implements a dual-layer learning approach:

- **Local Learning**: Project-specific patterns stored in ConPort under `local_mode_patterns`
- **Global Learning**: Cross-project patterns stored under `mode_enhancement_intelligence`

This allows the system to continuously improve its disambiguation and enhancement capabilities.

### Structured Enhancement Process

The enhancement process follows a systematic approach:

1. **Target Clarification**: Identify the domain and main goal
2. **Scope Definition**: Determine technical requirements
3. **Requirements Gathering**: Identify missing details, constraints, edge cases
4. **Structured Enhancement**: Apply appropriate template and techniques
5. **Validation**: Ensure the enhanced prompt meets quality standards

### Template Application

The system includes specialized templates for different types of prompts:

- **Basic Template**: General-purpose prompt structure
- **Technical Template**: Detailed technical specifications for backend/API tasks
- **UI Template**: Specialized for UI component development

### Validation and Auto-Fixing

The validation system provides:

- Comprehensive validation against multiple quality metrics
- Automatic fixing of validation failures
- Detailed metrics tracking for continuous improvement

## ConPort Integration

The Prompt Enhancer Mode is deeply integrated with ConPort:

1. **Knowledge Retrieval**:
   - Disambiguation patterns
   - Enhancement techniques
   - Prompt templates
   - Project glossary

2. **Knowledge Persistence**:
   - Records enhancement results
   - Logs disambiguation patterns
   - Tracks validation metrics
   - Stores successful enhancement patterns

3. **Learning Loop**:
   - Updates patterns based on enhancement success
   - Improves disambiguation accuracy over time
   - Adapts to project-specific terminology

## Usage Examples

See `examples/prompt-enhancer-mode-enhancement-usage.js` for comprehensive usage examples:

- Basic prompt enhancement
- Handling disambiguation with clarification
- Using specific templates
- Accessing enhancement history and metrics

## Implementation Decision

The implementation follows the "Mode-Specific Knowledge-First Enhancement Pattern" (System Pattern #31) established during the Architect Mode implementation. This pattern ensures consistent structure across all mode enhancements while allowing for mode-specific validation and knowledge requirements.

### Decision Log

This implementation corresponds to Decision #63: "Prompt Enhancer Mode Knowledge-First Implementation Approach", which defined:

1. The three-component architecture (validation, knowledge-first, integration)
2. The specialized validation checkpoints for prompt quality
3. The disambiguation engine for separating content from meta-instructions
4. The dual-layer learning system for continuous improvement

### System Pattern

This implementation establishes System Pattern #33: "Prompt Disambiguation Pattern", which defines:

1. Confidence-based segment classification
2. Clarification request generation for low-confidence segments
3. Meta-instruction processing workflow
4. Learning mechanism for improving disambiguation accuracy

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. **Advanced Semantic Disambiguation**: Implementing more sophisticated NLP techniques for disambiguation
2. **Domain-Specific Templates**: Expanding template library for more specialized domains
3. **Interactive Enhancement**: Real-time collaborative prompt enhancement workflow
4. **Cross-Mode Knowledge Sharing**: Sharing enhancement patterns across different modes
