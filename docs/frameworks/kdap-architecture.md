# Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning (KDAP) Architecture

## Overview

The Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning (KDAP) system enables ConPort to autonomously identify knowledge gaps, plan knowledge acquisition activities, and execute those plans to continuously improve the knowledge base without requiring constant human guidance.

## Design Principles

1. **Knowledge Awareness**: KDAP maintains awareness of the current state of the knowledge ecosystem
2. **Goal-Oriented Planning**: All planning activities are driven by specific knowledge improvement goals
3. **Adaptive Strategies**: Planning strategies adapt based on prior outcomes and changing contexts
4. **Minimally Disruptive**: Knowledge acquisition activities integrate naturally with user workflows
5. **Self-Evaluation**: The system continuously evaluates its own effectiveness and adjusts accordingly

## System Architecture

KDAP follows our established three-layer architecture:

### 1. Validation Layer (`kdap-validation.js`)

Responsible for:
- Validating knowledge gap assessments for completeness and accuracy
- Ensuring generated plans meet quality standards
- Verifying that execution is proceeding as expected
- Checking that acquired knowledge meets defined criteria

Key components:
- Gap Assessment Validator
- Plan Quality Validator
- Execution Monitor
- Knowledge Acquisition Quality Checker

### 2. Knowledge-First Core (`kdap-core.js`)

Responsible for:
- Analyzing the knowledge base to identify gaps and opportunities
- Formulating plans to address those gaps
- Executing plans through appropriate mechanisms
- Evaluating the success of knowledge acquisition activities

Key components:
- Knowledge State Analyzer
- Gap Identification Engine
- Plan Generation System
- Execution Orchestrator
- Knowledge Impact Evaluator

#### Knowledge State Analyzer

This component builds a comprehensive model of the current knowledge ecosystem:
- Inventories existing knowledge by category, source, and quality
- Maps relationships between knowledge elements
- Identifies usage patterns and access frequency
- Assesses knowledge coverage across domains

#### Gap Identification Engine

This component applies multiple strategies to identify knowledge gaps:
- Coverage analysis (domains with limited information)
- Depth analysis (areas with shallow knowledge)
- Freshness analysis (outdated knowledge)
- Quality analysis (areas with low-confidence knowledge)
- Relationship analysis (missing connections between knowledge items)
- Usage analysis (frequently accessed but limited knowledge areas)

#### Plan Generation System

This component creates actionable plans to address identified gaps:
- Prioritizes gaps based on impact and acquisition effort
- Selects appropriate acquisition strategies (research, inference, user queries)
- Schedules activities based on urgency and resource availability
- Creates structured plans with measurable outcomes

#### Execution Orchestrator

This component carries out knowledge acquisition plans:
- Selects appropriate tools and mechanisms for each planned activity
- Coordinates with other ConPort components
- Manages timing and sequencing of activities
- Handles interruptions and plan adjustments

#### Knowledge Impact Evaluator

This component evaluates the outcomes of knowledge acquisition:
- Measures changes in knowledge coverage and quality
- Assesses accuracy and relevance of newly acquired knowledge
- Evaluates user satisfaction with knowledge improvements
- Provides feedback for improving future planning

### 3. Integration Layer (`kdap-integration.js`)

Responsible for:
- Connecting KDAP with existing ConPort components
- Facilitating communication with other autonomous frameworks
- Providing APIs for external interaction with KDAP
- Managing state persistence and synchronization

Key components:
- ConPort Knowledge Interface
- Autonomous Framework Connectors
- External API Handler
- State Management System

## Data Flow

1. Knowledge State Analyzer pulls current knowledge state from ConPort
2. Gap Identification Engine processes this state to identify gaps
3. Plan Generation System creates plans to address high-priority gaps
4. Execution Orchestrator implements these plans through appropriate mechanisms
5. Knowledge Impact Evaluator assesses the outcomes
6. Results feed back to update the knowledge state and improve future planning

## Integration Points

### Integration with ConPort Core

- Reads from ConPort database to assess current knowledge state
- Writes new knowledge and relationships back to ConPort
- Utilizes ConPort's semantic search capabilities for gap analysis

### Integration with Other Autonomous Frameworks

- **Adaptive Knowledge Application Framework (AKAF)**: Coordinates to ensure acquired knowledge is optimized for application
- **Self-Improving Validation System (SIVS)**: Leverages improved validation patterns for knowledge quality assessment
- **Knowledge Synthesis Engine (KSE)**: Provides synthesized knowledge to fill identified gaps
- **Cognitive Continuity Framework (CCF)**: Ensures planning maintains continuity across sessions

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of knowledge state components
- Incremental updates to gap analysis
- Prioritized execution of high-impact plan elements
- Caching of frequently accessed knowledge elements

### Security and Privacy

- Respects knowledge access controls
- Maintains audit trail of autonomous actions
- Allows configuration of autonomy boundaries
- Provides transparency into planning decisions

### Extensibility

- Plugin architecture for custom gap identification strategies
- Configurable planning algorithms
- Extensible execution mechanisms
- Support for custom evaluation metrics

## Metrics and Measurement

To evaluate the effectiveness of KDAP, we'll track:

1. **Gap Coverage Rate**: Percentage of identified gaps successfully addressed
2. **Knowledge Quality Improvement**: Pre/post metrics on knowledge quality
3. **Planning Efficiency**: Resources required per knowledge gap addressed
4. **User Intervention Rate**: Frequency of required human assistance
5. **Knowledge Utilization Impact**: How acquired knowledge affects overall system performance

## Success Criteria

KDAP will be considered successful when it can:

1. Autonomously identify significant knowledge gaps without user guidance
2. Generate and execute effective acquisition plans with minimal supervision
3. Demonstrate measurable improvements in knowledge coverage and quality
4. Adapt its strategies based on past performance
5. Integrate seamlessly with user workflows and other system components
