# Autonomous Frameworks Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation for the autonomous frameworks that extend Roo's capabilities with intelligent, self-managing systems.

## Framework Documentation

### Knowledge Application & Planning
- **[AKAF - Adaptive Knowledge Application Framework](akaf-architecture.md)** 
  - Intelligently selects and applies stored knowledge to new contexts
  - Implementation: [`utilities/frameworks/akaf/`](../../utilities/frameworks/akaf/)

- **[KDAP - Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning](kdap-architecture.md)**
  - Autonomously identifies knowledge gaps and plans acquisition activities  
  - Implementation: [`utilities/frameworks/kdap/`](../../utilities/frameworks/kdap/)

### Optimization & Synthesis
- **[AMO - Autonomous Mapping Orchestrator](amo-architecture.md)**
  - Dynamically discovers and maps knowledge relationships
  - Implementation: [`utilities/frameworks/amo/`](../../utilities/frameworks/amo/)

- **[KSE - Knowledge Synthesis Engine](kse-architecture.md)**
  - Autonomously combines knowledge sources to generate new insights
  - Implementation: [`utilities/frameworks/kse/`](../../utilities/frameworks/kse/)

### Validation & Continuity  
- **[SIVS - Self-Improving Validation System](sivs-architecture.md)**
  - Multi-dimensional validation framework that learns and improves
  - Implementation: [`utilities/frameworks/sivs/`](../../utilities/frameworks/sivs/)

- **[CCF - Cognitive Continuity Framework](ccf-architecture.md)**
  - Ensures knowledge continuity across sessions, agents, and time periods
  - Implementation: [`utilities/frameworks/ccf/`](../../utilities/frameworks/ccf/)

## Implementation Status

All frameworks are **production-ready** with complete implementations including:

- ✅ Three-layer architecture (validation, core, integration)
- ✅ ConPort integration for knowledge management
- ✅ Cross-framework communication protocols
- ✅ Comprehensive test suites and validation
- ✅ Working demonstration examples
- ✅ Complete API documentation

## Architecture

Each framework follows a standardized three-layer architecture:

1. **Validation Layer** (`*-validation.js`) - Ensures data integrity and input validation
2. **Core Layer** (`*-core.js`) - Implements fundamental framework logic and operations  
3. **Integration Layer** (`*-integration.js`) - Handles external system communication and ConPort integration

## Usage

These frameworks can be used individually or in combination to create sophisticated knowledge management workflows. See the implementation directories for specific usage examples and API documentation.
