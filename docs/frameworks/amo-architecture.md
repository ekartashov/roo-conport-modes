# Autonomous Mapping Orchestrator (AMO) - Architecture Overview

## 1. Introduction

The Autonomous Mapping Orchestrator (AMO) is an autonomous framework responsible for dynamically discovering, mapping, and organizing knowledge relationships across the ConPort ecosystem. AMO transforms implicit connections between knowledge artifacts into explicit, navigable knowledge graphs that enable advanced knowledge traversal, discovery, and inference.

## 2. Strategic Purpose

AMO addresses several critical knowledge management challenges:

- **Relationship Discovery**: Automatically identifies semantic and logical relationships between knowledge artifacts that might otherwise remain undiscovered
- **Context Building**: Constructs rich contextual maps around knowledge artifacts, enhancing understanding and applicability
- **Knowledge Organization**: Creates meaningful organizational structures that transcend traditional hierarchical limitations
- **Insight Generation**: Uncovers non-obvious relationships and patterns that may yield new insights
- **Navigation Enhancement**: Enables intuitive traversal of complex knowledge spaces through relationship mapping

## 3. Core Capabilities

- Confidence scoring for identified relationships
- Bi-directional relationship establishment

### 3.2 Semantic Network Construction

## 4. Architecture Design

Following the established autonomous framework architecture pattern, AMO consists of three primary layers:

### 4.1 Validation Layer (`amo-validation.js`)

The validation layer provides specialized validators for AMO operations:

- **Relationship Validation**: Ensures relationship mappings meet quality standards
  - Validates source and target artifacts exist and are accessible
  - Verifies relationship type is valid and appropriate

  - Ensures compliance with knowledge graph integrity rules

- **Mapping Schema Validation**: Ensures mapping schemas are well-formed
  - Validates schema structure and required properties
  - Verifies custom mapping rules follow expected formats
  - Validates taxonomies and ontology definitions
  - Ensures backwards compatibility with existing schemas

- **Query Validation**: Ensures knowledge graph queries are valid
  - Validates query syntax and semantics
  - Verifies query parameters and constraints
  - Ensures performance considerations for complex queries
  - Validates output format specifications

### 4.2 Core Layer (`amo-core.js`)

The core layer contains the primary mapping and relationship management logic:

## 5. Interaction Flow

AMO operates with the following typical interaction flows:

1. **Knowledge Ingest Flow**:
   - New knowledge artifacts are added to ConPort
   - AMO identifies potential relationships to existing knowledge
   - Relationships are validated, scored, and classified
   - Knowledge graph is updated with new nodes and relationships
   - Related knowledge artifacts are notified of new connections

2. **Knowledge Query Flow**:
   - User or system component submits a knowledge query
   - Query is validated and optimized
   - Knowledge graph is traversed according to query parameters
   - Results are gathered, ranked, and formatted
   - Query results are returned with relationship context

3. **Relationship Discovery Flow**:
   - AMO periodically analyzes knowledge corpus for new relationships
   - Candidate relationships are identified through semantic analysis
   - Relationships are validated and scored
   - High-confidence relationships are proposed or automatically established
   - Knowledge graph is updated with new relationships

4. **Integration Support Flow**:
   - Autonomous framework requests relationship context
   - AMO provides relevant knowledge neighborhood
   - Relationship insights are integrated into framework operations
   - Frameworks report back relationship efficacy
   - AMO adjusts relationship scoring based on efficacy feedback

## 6. Key Design Principles

AMO adheres to the following design principles:

- **Dynamic Discovery**: Relationships are discovered dynamically rather than requiring manual definition
- **Confidence Scoring**: All relationships include confidence scores to indicate reliability
- **Relationship Types**: Relationships are typed and classified according to semantic meaning
- **Bidirectionality**: Relationships maintain bidirectional context and properties
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports scaling to large knowledge graphs
- **Performance**: Optimization for rapid traversal and query execution
- **Evolvability**: Knowledge graphs evolve as knowledge and relationships change
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with ConPort and autonomous frameworks

## 7. Implementation Priorities

The initial implementation of AMO will focus on:

1. Building the core relationship mapping capabilities
2. Establishing fundamental knowledge graph structures

  targetType: "system_pattern",
  type: "implements",

}
```

**Knowledge Query**:

  relationshipTypes: ["implements", "related_to"],
  direction: "outbound",
  filters: {
    itemTypes: ["system_pattern", "decision"],

- **SIVS**: More accurate validation with relationship neighborhood insights
- **KSE**: Richer knowledge synthesis with relationship-aware aggregation
- **CCF**: More effective continuity with relationship-based recommendations

By creating a navigable knowledge graph, AMO serves as the connective tissue between disparate knowledge artifacts, enabling more intelligent and context-aware knowledge operations across the ConPort ecosystem.
