# Phase 2: Mode Enhancements Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing mode-specific enhancements that build upon the foundation established in Phase 1. While Phase 1 created the core infrastructure (validation checkpoints, knowledge source classification, and knowledge-first guidelines), Phase 2 will tailor these capabilities to the specific needs and functions of each mode.

## Objectives

1. Create mode-specific implementations of Knowledge-First Guidelines
2. Implement custom validation checkpoints tailored to each mode's function
3. Develop enhanced knowledge metrics dashboards for monitoring effectiveness
4. Optimize knowledge utilization in each mode based on its unique requirements
