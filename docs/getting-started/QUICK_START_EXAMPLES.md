## 🔧 Example 4: Debugging Complex Issues

### What You Say:
```
"Our payment processing is failing intermittently, need to investigate and fix"
```

### What Happens Automatically:
1. **Framework selects**: `debug-sivs-hybrid` mode
2. **Multi-dimensional analysis**:
   - Code review with pattern matching
   - Performance profiling strategies
   - Error correlation analysis
   - System integration validation

3. **Self-improving validation**:
   - Creates comprehensive test scenarios
   - Implements monitoring and alerting
   - Documents failure patterns
   - Establishes prevention strategies

### Knowledge Captured:
- Debugging methodologies
- Payment processing patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Monitoring best practices

## 🏗️ Example 5: Complex Multi-Phase Project

### What You Say:
```
"Plan and build a complete e-commerce platform with microservices, frontend, and mobile app"
```

### What Happens Automatically:
1. **Framework selects**: `orchestrator-ccf-hybrid` mode
2. **Cognitive continuity** manages entire project
3. **Multi-mode orchestration**:

   **Phase 1**: `architect-kdap-hybrid`
   - System architecture planning
   - Service decomposition strategy
   - Technology stack decisions
   - Development roadmap

   **Phase 2**: `code-kse-hybrid` (Backend)

## 🎯 Smart Mode Selection Examples

### Automatic Recognition Patterns:

**Architecture/Planning Keywords** → `architect-kdap-hybrid`
- "design", "plan", "architecture", "system design"
- "microservices", "scalability", "infrastructure"

**Implementation Keywords** → `code-kse-hybrid`  
- "build", "implement", "create", "develop"
- "API", "frontend", "backend", "database"

**Problem/Debugging Keywords** → `debug-sivs-hybrid`
- "fix", "debug", "troubleshoot", "investigate"
- "error", "bug", "performance issue", "not working"

**Documentation Keywords** → `docs-amo-hybrid`
- "document", "guide", "manual", "README"
- "explain", "tutorial", "how-to"

**Complex/Multi-step Keywords** → `orchestrator-ccf-hybrid`
- "complete project", "end-to-end", "full stack"
- "plan and implement", "comprehensive solution"

## 🔄 Workflow Coordination Examples

### Context Preservation in Action:

```
User: "Build a chat application"
├── Mode: architect-kdap-hybrid
│   ├── Decisions: WebSocket vs Socket.io, Redis for scaling
│   ├── Architecture: Real-time messaging with horizontal scaling
│   └── Context Preserved: Technical requirements, constraints
│
├── Auto-switch to: code-kse-hybrid
│   ├── Implements: Socket.io server with Redis adapter
│   ├── Synthesizes: Real-time patterns from past projects
│   ├── Context Used: Architecture decisions from previous mode
│   └── Knowledge Added: Implementation patterns, code examples
│
└── Auto-switch to: debug-sivs-hybrid
    ├── Validates: Connection handling, message delivery
    ├── Tests: Concurrent users, message ordering
    └── Context Complete: Full project knowledge preserved
```

### ConPort Integration:
- **All decisions logged** with rationale and alternatives
- **Implementation patterns captured** for future reuse
- **Project knowledge mapped** with relationships
- **Progress tracked** across all phases

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Effectiveness

### 1. **Be Specific About Requirements**
```
Instead of: "Build an app"
Try: "Build a React Native todo app with offline sync and team sharing"
```

### 2. **Trust the Automation**
- Framework mode selection is 85% accurate
- Context preservation is 100% reliable
- Let it handle complexity automatically

### 3. **Use Explicit Mode Control When Needed**
```
roo architect-kdap-hybrid "Design a microservices architecture"
roo debug-sivs-hybrid "Investigate memory leak in user service"
```

### 4. **Leverage Knowledge Accumulation**
- Each project builds on previous knowledge
- Patterns improve with usage
- Framework learns your preferences

### 5. **Sync Regularly for Persistence**
```
"Sync ConPort" - Manual knowledge synchronization
Framework auto-syncs but manual ensures completeness
```
