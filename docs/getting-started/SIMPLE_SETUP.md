# Simple Setup Guide

**Get Roo Modes working in 5 minutes**

## Step 1: Choose Your Modes (1 minute)

Pick the modes you want from the [`modes/`](modes/) folder:

- **`architect.yaml`** - For planning and system design
- **`code.yaml`** - For programming and development
- **`debug.yaml`** - For troubleshooting and fixing issues
- **`docs.yaml`** - For writing and organizing documentation
- **`ask.yaml`** - For research and Q&A

**Don't overthink it** - you can always add more later.

## Step 2: Copy to Roo (2 minutes)

Copy your chosen mode files to your Roo configuration directory:

**Windows:**
```
%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\
```

**Mac:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/
```

**Linux:**
```
~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/
```

Just drag and drop the YAML files there.

## Step 3: Start Using (2 minutes)

That's it! Your AI now has these new modes available.

**Try it out:**
1. Ask your AI: *"Switch to architect mode and help me plan a web application"*
2. Or: *"Use code mode to implement a login function"*
3. Or: *"Debug mode - why is my function not working?"*

## What Happens Next?

- Your AI will automatically use the enhanced capabilities
- It will start building a knowledge base of your decisions and patterns
- Each interaction will make future responses more relevant to your work

## Need More?

- **Want hybrid modes?** Copy files from [`modes/hybrid/`](modes/hybrid/) too
- **Having issues?** Check [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- **Want to understand more?** Read [`WHAT_EACH_MODE_DOES.md`](WHAT_EACH_MODE_DOES.md)

**That's really it.** No complex configuration, no dependencies to install. Just copy, paste, and go.
