# Knowledge Quality Enhancement System

## Overview

The Knowledge Quality Enhancement System is a Phase 3 component of the ConPort architecture that enables systematic assessment, enhancement, and monitoring of knowledge quality across the ConPort ecosystem. It provides comprehensive capabilities for evaluating quality dimensions such as completeness, accuracy, clarity, and consistency, with mechanisms for automated quality enhancement, trend analysis, and threshold management.

## Architecture

The Knowledge Quality Enhancement System follows the established three-layer architecture:

1. **Validation Layer** (`knowledge-quality-validation.js`): Ensures all inputs to the system are valid and properly structured, preventing corruption of the knowledge base through invalid operations.

2. **Knowledge-First Core** (`knowledge-quality-core.js`): Implements the core quality assessment and enhancement algorithms that operate independently of ConPort integration, focusing on universal knowledge quality principles.

3. **Integration Layer** (`knowledge-quality.js`): Provides a simplified API that integrates with ConPort, handling artifact retrieval, storage, and context management.

## Key Capabilities

### Quality Assessment

The system provides multi-dimensional quality assessment for ConPort artifacts:

- **Completeness**: Evaluates whether all required information is present
- **Accuracy**: Measures factual correctness and precision
- **Clarity**: Assesses how well the information is communicated
- **Consistency**: Checks for contradictions or discrepancies
- **Structure**: Evaluates organization and formattin
- **Relevance**: Measures alignment with project goals and context
- **Traceability**: Assesses connections to related artifacts
- **Accessibility**: Evaluates how easily information can be found and used

Each dimension is evaluated through various criteria, generating both quantitative scores and qualitative feedback.

### Quality Enhancement

The system can automatically enhance artifact quality through:

- **Completeness Enhancement**: Identifying and filling missing information
- **Clarity Enhancement**: Improving readability and understandability
- **Structure Enhancement**: Reorganizing content for better navigation
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Adding tags, timestamps, and relationships
- **Reference Enhancement**: Adding supporting references and context

Enhancements can be applied selectively or comprehensively, with options to create new versions that preserve the original.

### Quality Criteria Management

The system supports defining and managing quality criteria:

- **Custom Criteria Definition**: Create project-specific quality measures
- **Weighted Evaluation**: Prioritize dimensions based on project needs
- **Artifact-Specific Criteria**: Apply different standards to different artifact types

### Threshold Management

Quality thresholds help maintain knowledge standards:

- **Dimensional Thresholds**: Set minimum quality levels for specific dimensions
- **Alert Levels**: Configure warnings or errors when thresholds are violated
- **Automated Actions**: Trigger enhancement suggestions or notifications

### Quality Reporting

Comprehensive reporting capabilities include:

- **Quality Dashboards**: Overview of quality metrics across artifacts
- **Issue Identification**: Pinpointing specific quality problems
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracking quality changes over time
- **Enhancement Impact**: Measuring the effectiveness of quality improvements

### Batch Processing

Efficiently process multiple artifacts:

- **Concurrent Assessment**: Evaluate multiple artifacts simultaneously
- **Prioritized Enhancement**: Focus on artifacts with the greatest need
- **Quality Scans**: Regularly check the entire knowledge base

## Implementation Details

### Quality Assessment Algorithm

The quality assessment process follows these steps:

1. **Artifact Retrieval**: Get the artifact content from ConPort
2. **Criteria Selection**: Determine which quality criteria apply
3. **Dimensional Evaluation**: Score each dimension based on its criteria
4. **Score Aggregation**: Calculate an overall quality score
5. **Improvement Identification**: Generate suggestions for enhancement

### Quality Enhancement Process

The enhancement process follows these steps:

1. **Enhancement Selection**: Determine which enhancements to apply
2. **Enhancement Application**: Apply the selected enhancements
3. **Version Management**: Create a new version if requested
4. **Quality Reassessment**: Evaluate the enhanced artifact

### ConPort Integration

The system integrates with ConPort through:

- **Artifact Access**: Reading artifacts from various ConPort collections
- **Quality Storage**: Storing quality metrics in custom data
- **Version Management**: Creating and tracking artifact versions
- **Context Updates**: Recording quality issues in active context
- **Notification System**: Alerting users to quality problems

## Usage

### Basic Quality Assessment

```javascript
const qualityResult = await knowledgeQuality.assessQuality({
  artifactType: 'decision',
  artifactId: '123',
  qualityDimensions: ['completeness', 'accuracy', 'clarity']
});

console.log(`Overall quality score: ${qualityResult.overallScore}/100`);
```

### Quality Enhancement

```javascript
const enhancementResult = await knowledgeQuality.enhanceQuality({
  artifactType: 'system_pattern',
  artifactId: '456',
  enhancementTypes: ['completeness', 'clarity'],
  createNewVersion: true
});

console.log(`Applied ${enhancementResult.appliedEnhancements.length} enhancements`);
```

### Setting Quality Thresholds

```javascript
await knowledgeQuality.setQualityThreshold({
  dimension: 'completeness',
  threshold: 75,
  artifactTypes: ['decision', 'system_pattern'],
  alertLevel: 'warning'
});
```

### Batch Quality Assessment

```javascript
const batchResult = await knowledgeQuality.batchAssessQuality({
  artifacts: [
    { artifactType: 'decision', artifactId: '123' },
    { artifactType: 'system_pattern', artifactId: '456' }
  ],
  qualityDimensions: ['completeness', 'accuracy']
});
```

### Quality Trend Analysis

```javascript
const trendAnalysis = await knowledgeQuality.analyzeQualityTrend({
  artifactType: 'decision',
  artifactId: '123',
  startDate: '2025-03-15T00:00:00Z',
  endDate: '2025-06-15T00:00:00Z'
});
```

### Comprehensive Quality Report

```javascript
const qualityReport = await knowledgeQuality.generateQualityReport({
  artifactTypes: ['decision', 'system_pattern', 'document'],
  includeDetails: true,
  includeTrends: true
});
```

See `examples/knowledge-quality-usage.js` for comprehensive usage examples.
