# Mode Engineer Architectural Correction - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
The Mode Engineer architectural inconsistency has been successfully resolved. The meta-mode is now properly integrated into the established functional organization of the roo-conport-modes project.

## What Was Corrected

### Original Issue
The Mode Engineer was incorrectly placed in `utilities/mode-engineering/`, which violated the established four-stage knowledge evolution framework and created architectural debt.

### Solution Applied
Relocated Mode Engineer to `utilities/frameworks/mode-engineer/` where it belongs with other autonomous frameworks that answer "How can knowledge drive action?"

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Correction ✅
```bash
# Successfully executed
mv utilities/mode-engineering utilities/frameworks/mode-engineer
```

**Result:** Mode Engineer now properly located alongside:
- `utilities/frameworks/akaf/` - Adaptive Knowledge Application Framework
- `utilities/frameworks/amo/` - Autonomous Mode Optimization  
- `utilities/frameworks/ccf/` - Cognitive Continuity Framework
- `utilities/frameworks/kdap/` - Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Planning
- `utilities/frameworks/kse/` - Knowledge Synthesis Engine
- `utilities/frameworks/mode-engineer/` - **Mode Engineering Meta-Framework** ✅
- `utilities/frameworks/sivs/` - Self-Improving Validation System

### 2. Configuration Updates ✅
**File:** `modes/mode-engineer.yaml`
- ✅ Line 246: Updated utility path reference
- ✅ Line 253: Updated require statement example
- ✅ Line 274: Updated permissions edit path

### 3. Code Reference Updates ✅
**File:** `utilities/frameworks/mode-engineer/mode-engineer-validation.js`
- ✅ Line 311: Updated validation check path reference

### 4. Documentation Updates ✅
**File:** `docs/mode-engineer-implementation-guide.md`
- ✅ Updated all file path references throughout the document

## Verification Results

### Framework Integration Status ✅
The Mode Engineer is now properly positioned as the **7th autonomous framework** in the utilities/frameworks/ directory:

```
utilities/frameworks/
├── README.md
├── akaf/                    # Framework 1
├── amo/                     # Framework 2
├── ccf/                     # Framework 3
├── kdap/                    # Framework 4
├── kse/                     # Framework 5
├── mode-engineer/          # Framework 6 ✅ (Meta-Framework)
└── sivs/                   # Framework 7
```

### Path Reference Verification ✅
All functional references have been updated:
- ✅ YAML configuration paths corrected
