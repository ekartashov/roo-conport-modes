### Total Synchronized: 8/8 Mode Files

## Enhancement Framework Applied

Each local mode file now includes:

### 1. Intelligent Disambiguation Engine
- Confidence-based decision framework (80% threshold)
- Mode-specific disambiguation patterns
- Context-aware approach selection

### 2. Dual-Layer Learning Integration
- ConPort category-specific learning
- Historical pattern application
- Adaptive confidence thresholds

### 3. Universal Framework Components
- Consistent confidence threshold standards
- Systematic approach selection
- Progressive complexity handling

## Configuration Consistency Verification

### Global vs Local Alignment: ✅ VERIFIED
- All global enhancements replicated in local files
- Mode-specific customizations preserved
- Universal framework consistently applied

### Framework Integration: ✅ COMPLETE
- Intelligent disambiguation in all modes
- ConPort learning integration maintained
- Confidence-based decision making standardized

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Completed:
- ✅ All 8 mode files contain disambiguation engines
- ✅ Mode-specific patterns correctly implemented
- ✅ Universal framework consistently applied
- ✅ Existing ConPort integration preserved
- ✅ File structure and formatting maintained

### Testing Readiness:
- All enhanced modes ready for user interaction
- Disambiguation engines prepared for confidence-based decisions
- ConPort learning categories properly referenced

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. System Consistency
- Uniform intelligent behavior across all modes
- Consistent user experience globally and locally
- Standardized disambiguation methodology

### 2. Enhanced Intelligence
- 80% confidence thresholds for reliable decisions
- Mode-specific expertise with universal intelligence
- Adaptive learning from ConPort knowledge base

### 3. Maintainability
- Single source of truth for enhancement patterns
