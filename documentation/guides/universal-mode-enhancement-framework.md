# Universal Mode Enhancement Framework

## Overview

This framework consolidates the universal enhancement concepts discovered through the Prompt Enhancer mode overhaul, providing systematic guidelines for improving all Roo AI modes with intelligent disambiguation, dual-layer learning, and confidence-based decision making.

## Core Enhancement Patterns

### 1. Intelligent Disambiguation Engine

**Pattern**: Separate content from meta-instructions using confidence-based analysis

**Universal Application**:
- **Input Analysis**: Parse user input for task content vs mode directives
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate classification confidence (0-100%)
- **Threshold-Based Actions**: Auto-process ≥80%, clarify <80%
- **Learning Integration**: Track patterns and corrections

**Implementation Template**:
```yaml
customInstructions: >-
  **INTELLIGENT DISAMBIGUATION ENGINE:**
  
  **Phase 1: Input Analysis with Confidence Scoring (≥80% threshold)**
  1. **Load Context Patterns**: Retrieve local project patterns and global intelligence
  2. **Semantic Analysis**: Parse input for content vs meta-instruction indicators
  3. **Confidence Calculation**: Score each segment (0-100%) using dual-layer patterns
  4. **Disambiguation Decision**:
     - ≥80% confidence: Proceed with classification
     - <80% confidence: Trigger clarification questions

  **Phase 2: Intelligent Clarification (when confidence <80%)**
  Ask targeted questions to resolve ambiguity:
  - "Should I treat '[ambiguous phrase]' as [task content] or [mode instruction]?"
  - "Are you asking me to [perform action] or [enhance/analyze] this content?"
```

### 2. Dual-Layer Learning System

**Pattern**: Combine local project adaptation with global cross-mode intelligence

**Universal Application**:
- **Local Learning**: Project-specific patterns, terminology, workflows
- **Global Learning**: Cross-project patterns, universal improvements
- **Continuous Adaptation**: Learn from user corrections and successful patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Apply insights across similar contexts

**Implementation Template**:
```yaml
customInstructions: >-
  **DUAL-LAYER LEARNING SYSTEM:**

  **Local Learning (Project ConPort):**
  - Track project-specific tool names and frameworks
  - Build domain vocabulary for team terminology
  - Adapt to project communication patterns
  - Store in ConPort category: `local_mode_patterns`

  **Global Learning (Cross-Project):**
  - Universal disambiguation patterns
  - Common tool/content separation rules
  - Mode behavioral improvements
  - Store in ConPort category: `mode_enhancement_intelligence`
```

### 3. Confidence-Based Decision Making

**Pattern**: Use probabilistic analysis for uncertain situations

**Universal Application**:
- **Classification Confidence**: Score decisions before acting
- **Graduated Responses**: Different actions based on confidence levels
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Clear paths when confidence is insufficient
- **Learning Feedback**: Track confidence accuracy for improvement

**Implementation Template**:
```yaml
customInstructions: >-
  **CONFIDENCE-BASED EXAMPLES:**

  **High Confidence (90%+) - Auto-classify:**
  Input: [Clear task description]
  → Classification: Content (task description)
  → Action: Process directly

  **Medium Confidence (60-79%) - Clarify:**
  Input: [Ambiguous mixed content]
  → Response: "I see both [type A] and [type B]. Should I:
  1. [Option A with specific action]?
  2. Or [Option B with alternative]?"

  **Learning Integration:**
  - Track all classifications and user corrections
  - Update confidence patterns in appropriate layer (local/global)
  - Build disambiguation vocabulary continuously
```

### 4. ConPort Integration Standards

**Pattern**: Systematic knowledge management for mode improvements

**Universal Application**:
- **Decision Logging**: Track mode behavior decisions and rationale
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify and document successful approaches
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor mode effectiveness and user satisfaction
- **Relationship Building**: Link mode improvements to outcomes

**Implementation Template**:
```yaml
customInstructions: >-
  **CONPORT INTEGRATION:**
  - Log all significant mode decisions with `log_decision`
  - Track successful patterns with `log_system_pattern`
  - Monitor improvement progress with `log_progress`
  - Store mode-specific knowledge with `log_custom_data`
  - Build relationships between improvements and outcomes
```

## Mode-Specific Adaptation Guidelines

### Code Mode Enhancements

**Disambiguation Focus**: Separate code requests from code analysis/review requests
**Learning Areas**: Project coding patterns, architecture preferences, debugging approaches
**Confidence Applications**: Classify implementation vs review vs refactoring requests

### Debug Mode Enhancements

**Disambiguation Focus**: Distinguish bug reports from debug process instructions
**Learning Areas**: Common error patterns, effective debugging strategies, project-specific issues
**Confidence Applications**: Classify error analysis vs reproduction vs fix implementation

### Architect Mode Enhancements

**Disambiguation Focus**: Separate architecture requests from architecture analysis
**Learning Areas**: Design pattern preferences, scalability requirements, team constraints
**Confidence Applications**: Classify design vs planning vs evaluation requests

### Ask Mode Enhancements

**Disambiguation Focus**: Distinguish information requests from teaching requests
**Learning Areas**: User knowledge level, preferred explanation depth, domain expertise
**Confidence Applications**: Classify conceptual vs practical vs comparative questions

### Documentation Modes Enhancements

**Disambiguation Focus**: Separate content creation from content improvement requests
**Learning Areas**: Documentation standards, team preferences, project-specific requirements
**Confidence Applications**: Classify creation vs auditing vs restructuring requests

### ConPort Maintenance Enhancements

**Disambiguation Focus**: Distinguish maintenance tasks from ConPort usage instructions
**Learning Areas**: Data quality patterns, project-specific cleanup needs, governance preferences
**Confidence Applications**: Classify audit vs cleanup vs optimization requests

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Enhancement Type | Implementation Effort | Impact Level | Priority |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------|----------|
| Disambiguation Engine | Medium | High | 1 |
| ConPort Integration | Low | High | 2 |
| Confidence-Based Decisions | Medium | Medium | 3 |
| Dual-Layer Learning | High | High | 4 |
