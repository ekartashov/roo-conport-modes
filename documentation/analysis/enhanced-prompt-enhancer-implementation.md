# Enhanced Prompt Enhancer Implementation Complete

## Summary of Changes Applied

✅ **Successfully updated global custom_modes.yaml** with the enhanced Prompt Enhancer configuration including:

### 1. **Intelligent Disambiguation Engine**
- 80% confidence threshold for automatic classification
- Semantic analysis of content vs meta-instructions
- Automatic clarification when confidence is low

### 2. **Dual-Layer Learning System**
- **Local Learning**: Project-specific patterns stored in ConPort (`local_mode_patterns`)
- **Global Learning**: Universal patterns stored in ConPort (`mode_enhancement_intelligence`)

### 3. **Enhanced Role Definition**
Updated from basic prompt enhancement to intelligent disambiguation with continuous learning capabilities.

### 4. **Confidence-Based Decision Making**
- ≥80% confidence: Auto-proceed with classification
- <80% confidence: Ask clarifying questions
- Continuous learning from user corrections

## How to Test the Enhanced Mode

### Test Case 1: High Confidence Content (Should auto-classify)
```
Input: "Create a REST API for user management with authentication"
Expected: Direct enhancement without clarification
```

### Test Case 2: Ambiguous Input (Should trigger clarification)
```
Input: "Use ConPort to load project data and create an API"
Expected: Clarification question about ConPort usage vs content
```

### Test Case 3: Mixed Content (Should trigger clarification)
```
Input: "Please activate GitHub integration and build a CI pipeline"
Expected: Question about which parts are instructions vs content
```

## Learning Integration Features

### Local Pattern Building
- Mode will learn project-specific terminology
- Builds vocabulary for team communication styles
- Adapts to company-specific tools and frameworks

### Global Pattern Recognition
- Universal disambiguation rules
- Cross-project knowledge transfer
- Systematic mode improvement

## ConPort Integration Schema

### Local Patterns (Project-Specific)
```json
{
  "category": "local_mode_patterns",
  "key": "prompt_enhancer_project_context",
  "value": {
    "project_specific_patterns": [...],
    "domain_vocabulary": {...},
    "local_confidence_adjustments": {...}
  }
}
```

### Global Intelligence (Cross-Project)
```json
{
  "category": "mode_enhancement_intelligence", 
  "key": "prompt_enhancer_patterns",
  "value": {
    "disambiguation_patterns": [...],
    "correction_learning": [...],
    "confidence_thresholds": {...}
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Enhanced Mode**: Switch to prompt-enhancer mode and test with various input types
2. **Monitor Learning**: Check ConPort for pattern building and learning integration
3. **Validate Confidence Scoring**: Ensure 80% threshold works effectively
4. **Document Corrections**: Track how the mode learns from user feedback

## Implementation Status

✅ **Global configuration updated**
✅ **Enhanced role definition applied**  
✅ **Intelligent disambiguation engine implemented**
✅ **Dual-layer learning system configured**
✅ **ConPort integration schema defined**

The enhanced Prompt Enhancer is now ready for use with intelligent content/directive separation and continuous learning capabilities.
