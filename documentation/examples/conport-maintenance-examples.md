# ConPort Maintenance Examples

## Overview

This document provides real-world examples of using the ConPort Maintenance mode to audit, optimize, and maintain ConPort databases for enhanced AI agent effectiveness.

## Basic Maintenance Operations

### Example 1: Initial Database Audit

**Scenario:** New project with 3 months of ConPort data, experiencing slow AI agent responses

**Input:**
```
"Audit the ConPort database for quality issues"
```

**ConPort Maintenance Process:**
```
1. Workspace Connectivity Check
   - Verify ConPort MCP connection
   - Confirm workspace ID: /home/user/projects/ecommerce-platform

2. Data Quality Analysis
   - Product Context: Last updated 2 weeks ago, contains outdated architecture decisions
   - Active Context: 15 entries, some duplicates identified
   - Decisions: 45 entries, 12 marked as superseded but not archived
   - Progress: 120 entries, 30 completed tasks still showing "IN_PROGRESS"
   - System Patterns: 8 patterns, missing relationships to implementing decisions

3. Quality Issues Identified
   - 12 outdated decisions cluttering search results
   - 30 stale progress entries affecting current task visibility
   - Low knowledge graph connectivity (18% vs 30% target)
   - 3 potential sensitive data exposures in decision rationale

4. Recommended Actions
   - Archive superseded decisions with proper linking
   - Update progress status for completed tasks
   - Create 15 new relationships between patterns and decisions
   - Scan and clean sensitive data references
```

```

### Example 2: Knowledge Graph Optimization

**Scenario:** Mature project with good data volume but poor interconnectivity

**Input:**
```
"Optimize the knowledge graph connectivity for better AI agent effectiveness"
```

**ConPort Maintenance Process:**
```
1. Connectivity Analysis
   - Current relationship density: 22%
   - Unlinked decisions: 18 out of 60
   - Isolated system patterns: 4 out of 12
   - Progress entries without decision links: 45 out of 150

2. Relationship Opportunities Identified
   - Decision D-42 (API rate limiting) → System Pattern SP-7 (rate limiting implementation)
   - Progress P-89 (JWT implementation) → Decision D-31 (authentication strategy)
   - System Pattern SP-3 (error handling) → Multiple progress entries
   - Custom Data CD-AuthFlow → Decision D-15 (OAuth integration)

3. Strategic Linking Process
   - Create "implements" relationships: decisions to patterns
   - Create "tracks" relationships: progress to decisions
   - Create "clarifies" relationships: custom data to decisions
   - Create "blocks" relationships: prerequisite patterns

4. Semantic Clustering
   - Authentication cluster: 8 items linked
   - Performance cluster: 12 items linked
   - Security cluster: 15 items linked
   - Architecture cluster: 20 items linked
```

**Implementation:**
```
# Created Relationships (15 new links)

## Authentication Cluster
- Decision D-31 "Authentication Strategy" 
  → implements → System Pattern SP-8 "JWT Implementation"
- Progress P-89 "JWT Token Service"
  → tracks → Decision D-31 "Authentication Strategy"
- Custom Data "AuthFlow Diagram"
  → clarifies → Decision D-31 "Authentication Strategy"

## Performance Cluster

- Cross-reference Accuracy: +60% improvement
```

### Example 3: Security Scan and Cleanup

**Scenario:** Post-incident security review of ConPort database

**Input:**
```
"Perform comprehensive security scan and clean any sensitive data exposure"
```

**ConPort Maintenance Process:**
```
1. Sensitive Data Pattern Scanning
   - API keys: 4 potential matches found
   - Database credentials: 2 confirmed exposures
   - Personal data: 1 email address in test data
   - JWT secrets: 1 development secret exposed

2. Context Analysis
   - Decision D-23: Contains AWS access key in rationale
   - Custom Data "DB Config": Plain text database password
   - Progress P-67: Developer email in implementation notes
   - System Pattern SP-5: JWT secret in example code

3. Risk Assessment
   - High Risk: 2 items (production credentials)
   - Medium Risk: 1 item (development secret)
   - Low Risk: 1 item (personal email)

4. Cleanup Actions Performed
   - Replaced credentials with placeholder text
   - Moved sensitive config to secure external references
   - Anonymized personal data
   - Updated patterns with secure examples
```

**Security Report:**
```
# ConPort Security Scan Report
Scan Date: 2024-01-15T14:45:00Z
Workspace: /home/user/projects/fintech-app

## Summary
- Total Items Scanned: 234
- Sensitive Data Found: 4 instances
- Risk Level: HIGH (production credentials exposed)
- Cleanup Status: COMPLETED
- Follow-up Required: Rotate compromised credentials

## Detailed Findings

### HIGH RISK - Production Credentials
**Decision D-23: "AWS Integration Strategy"**
- Location: rationale field, line 3
- Exposure: AWS access key (AKIA...)
- Action: Replaced with "[AWS_ACCESS_KEY - moved to secure vault]"
- Follow-up: Rotate AWS credentials immediately

**Custom Data: "Database Configuration"**
- Location: value field, connection string
- Exposure: PostgreSQL password
- Action: Updated to reference environment variable
- Follow-up: Update production password

### MEDIUM RISK - Development Secrets
**System Pattern SP-5: "JWT Authentication"**
- Location: example code section
- Exposure: JWT signing secret
- Action: Replaced with secure placeholder
- Follow-up: Ensure development secrets differ from production

### LOW RISK - Personal Data
**Progress P-67: "API Testing Results"**
- Location: implementation_details field
- Exposure: Developer email address
- Action: Anonymized to "developer@company.com"
- Follow-up: None required

## Recommendations
1. Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent credential commits
2. Use environment variable references in ConPort entries
3. Regular security scans (monthly minimum)
4. Team training on secure documentation practices
```

   - Linked individual progress to team goals
   - Established pattern ownership and review process
   - Implemented collaborative relationship building
```

**Team Optimization Plan:**
```
# Team ConPort Collaboration Framework

## Standardization (Week 1)

- Progress Template: Task → Status → Blockers → Related Decisions
- Pattern Template: Problem → Solution → Implementation → Examples
- Custom Data: Category → Key → Value → Relationships

## Collaboration Workflows (Week 2)
- Daily: Link new progress to relevant decisions
- Weekly: Team review of new decisions and patterns
- Monthly: Cross-team relationship building session
- Quarterly: Full knowledge graph optimization

## Quality Gates

- Progress entries must link to implementing decision
- Patterns require real-world usage examples
- Custom data needs clear category classification

## Team Responsibilities
- Developer A: Decision-Pattern relationship building
- Developer B: Progress-Decision linking champion  
- Developer C: Pattern documentation and examples
- Team Lead: Context coherence and quality oversight

## Success Metrics
- Team Knowledge Graph Connectivity: Target 45%

## Common Maintenance Patterns

### Pattern 1: Stale Progress Cleanup
**Trigger:** Progress entries with "IN_PROGRESS" status older than 2 weeks
**Action:** Update status, link to outcomes, archive if completed

### Pattern 2: Orphaned Decision Linking
**Trigger:** Decisions without implementing progress or patterns
**Action:** Create strategic relationships or mark for team review

### Pattern 3: Pattern-Implementation Gaps
**Trigger:** System patterns without real-world usage examples
**Action:** Link to implementing code, add usage examples

### Pattern 4: Sensitive Data Prevention
**Trigger:** New entries containing potential credentials or secrets
**Action:** Immediate cleanup, team notification, process improvement

## Best Practices for Maintenance

1. **Regular Scheduling**: Consistent maintenance prevents major issues
2. **Progressive Analysis**: Start with core contexts, expand to historical data
3. **Impact-Driven Priorities**: Focus on changes that improve AI agent effectiveness
4. **Audit Trail Maintenance**: Document all cleanup decisions for future reference
5. **Team Collaboration**: Involve multiple perspectives in relationship building
6. **Quality Metrics**: Track connectivity and effectiveness improvements over time
